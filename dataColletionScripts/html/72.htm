<title>72. The Jinn, Sprites</title>
<h1>Surah 72. The Jinn, Sprites</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> Say: It has been revealed to me that a company of Jinns listened (to the Qur'an). They said, 'We have really heard a wonderful Recital!
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> 'It gives guidance to the Right, and we have believed therein: we shall not join (in worship) any (gods) with our Lord.
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> 'And Exalted is the Majesty of our Lord: He has taken neither a wife nor a son.
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> 'There were some foolish ones among us, who used to utter extravagant lies against Allah.
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> 'But we do think that no man or spirit should say aught that untrue against Allah.
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> 'True, there were persons among mankind who took shelter with persons among the Jinns, but they increased them in folly.
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> 'And they (came to) think as ye thought, that Allah would not raise up any one (to Judgment).
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> 'And we pried into the secrets of heaven; but we found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires.
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> 'We used, indeed, to sit there in (hidden) stations, to (steal) a hearing; but any who listen now will find a flaming fire watching him in ambush.
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> 'And we understand not whether ill is intended to those on earth, or whether their Lord (really) intends to guide them to right conduct.
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> 'There are among us some that are righteous, and some the contrary: we follow divergent paths.
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> 'But we think that we can by no means frustrate Allah throughout the earth, nor can we frustrate Him by flight.
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> 'And as for us, since we have listened to the Guidance, we have accepted it: and any who believes in his Lord has no fear, either of a short (account) or of any injustice.
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> 'Amongst us are some that submit their wills (to Allah., and some that swerve from justice. Now those who submit their wills - they have sought out (the path) of right conduct:
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> 'But those who swerve,- they are (but) fuel for Hell-fire'-
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> (And Allah.s Message is): "If they (the Pagans) had (only) remained on the (right) Way, We should certainly have bestowed on them Rain in abundance.
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> "That We might try them by that (means). But if any turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He will cause him to undergo a severe Penalty.
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> "And the places of worship are for Allah (alone): So invoke not any one along with Allah.
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> "Yet when the Devotee of Allah stands forth to invoke Him, they just make round him a dense crowd."
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> Say: "I do no more than invoke my Lord, and I join not with Him any (false god)."
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> Say: "It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to right conduct."
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> Say: "No one can deliver me from Allah (If I were to disobey Him), nor should I find refuge except in Him,
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> "Unless I proclaim what I receive from Allah and His Messages: for any that disobey Allah and His Messenger,- for them is Hell: they shall dwell therein for ever."
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> At length, when they see (with their own eyes) that which they are promised,- then will they know who it is that is weakest in (his) helper and least important in point of numbers.
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> Say: "I know not whether the (Punishment) which ye are promised is near, or whether my Lord will appoint for it a distant term.
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> "He (alone) knows the Unseen, nor does He make any one acquainted with His Mysteries,-
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> "Except an apostle whom He has chosen: and then He makes a band of watchers march before him and behind him,
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> "That He may know that they have (truly) brought and delivered the Messages of their Lord: and He surrounds (all the mysteries) that are with them, and takes account of every single thing."
