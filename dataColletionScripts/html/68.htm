<title>68. The Pen, (the Letter) N</title>
<h1>Surah 68. The Pen, (the Letter) N</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> Nun. By the Pen and the (Record) which (men) write,-
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> Thou art not, by the Grace of thy Lord, mad or possessed.
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> Nay, verily for thee is a Reward unfailing:
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> And thou (standest) on an exalted standard of character.
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> Soon wilt thou see, and they will see,
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> Which of you is afflicted with madness.
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Verily it is thy Lord that knoweth best, which (among men) hath strayed from His Path: and He knoweth best those who receive (true) Guidance.
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> So hearken not to those who deny (the Truth).
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> Their desire is that thou shouldst be pliant: so would they be pliant.
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> Heed not the type of despicable men,- ready with oaths,
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> A slanderer, going about with calumnies,
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> (Habitually) hindering (all) good, transgressing beyond bounds, deep in sin,
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> Violent (and cruel),- with all that, base-born,-
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> Because he possesses wealth and (numerous) sons.
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> When to him are rehearsed Our Signs, "Tales of the ancients", he cries!
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> Soon shall We brand (the beast) on the snout!
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> Verily We have tried them as We tried the People of the Garden, when they resolved to gather the fruits of the (garden) in the morning.
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> But made no reservation, ("If it be Allah.s Will").
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> Then there came on the (garden) a visitation from thy Lord, (which swept away) all around, while they were asleep.
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> So the (garden) became, by the morning, like a dark and desolate spot, (whose fruit had been gathered).
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> As the morning broke, they called out, one to another,-
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> "Go ye to your tilth (betimes) in the morning, if ye would gather the fruits."
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> So they departed, conversing in secret low tones, (saying)-
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> "Let not a single indigent person break in upon you into the (garden) this day."
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> And they opened the morning, strong in an (unjust) resolve.
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> But when they saw the (garden), they said: "We have surely lost our way:
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> "Indeed we are shut out (of the fruits of our labour)!"
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> Said one of them, more just (than the rest): "Did I not say to you, 'Why not glorify ((Allah))?'"
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> They said: "Glory to our Lord! Verily we have been doing wrong!"
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> Then they turned, one against another, in reproach.
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> They said: "Alas for us! We have indeed transgressed!
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> "It may be that our Lord will give us in exchange a better (garden) than this: for we do turn to Him (in repentance)!"
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> Such is the Punishment (in this life); but greater is the Punishment in the Hereafter,- if only they knew!
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> Verily, for the Righteous, are Gardens of Delight, in the Presence of their Lord.
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> Shall We then treat the People of Faith like the People of Sin?
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> What is the matter with you? How judge ye?
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> Or have ye a book through which ye learn-
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> That ye shall have, through it whatever ye choose?
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> Or have ye Covenants with Us to oath, reaching to the Day of Judgment, (providing) that ye shall have whatever ye shall demand?
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> Ask thou of them, which of them will stand surety for that!
<p>
<A NAME="41"><b>41.</b></A> Or have they some "Partners" (in Allah.ead)? Then let them produce their "partners", if they are truthful!
<p>
<A NAME="42"><b>42.</b></A> The Day that the shin shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to bow in adoration, but they shall not be able,-
<p>
<A NAME="43"><b>43.</b></A> Their eyes will be cast down,- ignominy will cover them; seeing that they had been summoned aforetime to bow in adoration, while they were whole, (and had refused).
<p>
<A NAME="44"><b>44.</b></A> Then leave Me alone with such as reject this Message: by degrees shall We punish them from directions they perceive not.
<p>
<A NAME="45"><b>45.</b></A> A (long) respite will I grant them: truly powerful is My Plan.
<p>
<A NAME="46"><b>46.</b></A> Or is it that thou dost ask them for a reward, so that they are burdened with a load of debt?-
<p>
<A NAME="47"><b>47.</b></A> Or that the Unseen is in their hands, so that they can write it down?
<p>
<A NAME="48"><b>48.</b></A> So wait with patience for the Command of thy Lord, and be not like the Companion of the Fish,- when he cried out in agony.
<p>
<A NAME="49"><b>49.</b></A> Had not Grace from his Lord reached him, he would indeed have been cast off on the naked shore, in disgrace.
<p>
<A NAME="50"><b>50.</b></A> Thus did his Lord choose him and make him of the Company of the Righteous.
<p>
<A NAME="51"><b>51.</b></A> And the Unbelievers would almost trip thee up with their eyes when they hear the Message; and they say: "Surely he is possessed!"
<p>
<A NAME="52"><b>52.</b></A> But it is nothing less than a Message to all the worlds.
