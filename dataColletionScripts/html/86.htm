<h1>Surah 86. The Morning Star, The Nightcomer</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> By the Sky and the Night-Visitant (therein);-
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> And what will explain to thee what the Night-Visitant is?-
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> (It is) the Star of piercing brightness;-
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> There is no soul but has a protector over it.
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> Now let man but think from what he is created!
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> He is created from a drop emitted-
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs:
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> Surely ((Allah)) is able to bring him back (to life)!
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> The Day that (all) things secret will be tested,
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> (Man) will have no power, and no helper.
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> By the Firmament which returns (in its round),
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> And by the Earth which opens out (for the gushing of springs or the sprouting of vegetation),-
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> Behold this is the Word that distinguishes (Good from Evil):
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> It is not a thing for amusement.
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> As for them, they are but plotting a scheme,
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> And I am planning a scheme.
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> Therefore grant a delay to the Unbelievers: Give respite to them gently (for awhile).
