<title>62. The Congregation, Friday</title>
<h1>Surah 62. The Congregation, Friday</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> Whatever is in the heavens and on earth, doth declare the Praises and Glory of Allah,- the Sovereign, the Holy One, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> It is He Who has sent amongst the Unlettered an apostle from among themselves, to rehearse to them His Signs, to sanctify them, and to instruct them in Scripture and Wisdom,- although they had been, before, in manifest error;-
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> As well as (to confer all these benefits upon) others of them, who have not already joined them: And He is exalted in Might, Wise.
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> Such is the Bounty of Allah, which He bestows on whom He will: and Allah is the Lord of the highest bounty.
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> The similitude of those who were charged with the (obligations of the) Mosaic Law, but who subsequently failed in those (obligations), is that of a donkey which carries huge tomes (but understands them not). Evil is the similitude of people who falsify the Signs of Allah. and Allah guides not people who do wrong.
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> Say: "O ye that stand on Judaism! If ye think that ye are friends to Allah, to the exclusion of (other) men, then express your desire for Death, if ye are truthful!"
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> But never will they express their desire (for Death), because of the (deeds) their hands have sent on before them! and Allah knows well those that do wrong!
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> Say: "The Death from which ye flee will truly overtake you: then will ye be sent back to the Knower of things secret and open: and He will tell you (the truth of) the things that ye did!"
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> O ye who believe! When the call is proclaimed to prayer on Friday (the Day of Assembly), hasten earnestly to the Remembrance of Allah, and leave off business (and traffic): That is best for you if ye but knew!
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> And when the Prayer is finished, then may ye disperse through the land, and seek of the Bounty of Allah. and celebrate the Praises of Allah often (and without stint): that ye may prosper.
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> But when they see some bargain or some amusement, they disperse headlong to it, and leave thee standing. Say: "The (blessing) from the Presence of Allah is better than any amusement or bargain! and Allah is the Best to provide (for all needs)."
