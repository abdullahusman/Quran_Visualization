<h1>Surah 81. The Overthrowing, Extinguished! Wrapping Things Up</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> When the sun (with its spacious light) is folded up;
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> When the stars fall, losing their lustre;
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> When the mountains vanish (like a mirage);
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> When the she-camels, ten months with young, are left untended;
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> When the wild beasts are herded together (in the human habitations);
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> When the oceans boil over with a swell;
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> When the souls are sorted out, (being joined, like with like);
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> When the female (infant), buried alive, is questioned -
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> For what crime she was killed;
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> When the scrolls are laid open;
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> When the world on High is unveiled;
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> When the Blazing Fire is kindled to fierce heat;
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> And when the Garden is brought near;-
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> (Then) shall each soul know what it has put forward.
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> So verily I call to witness the planets - that recede,
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> Go straight, or hide;
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> And the Night as it dissipates;
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> And the Dawn as it breathes away the darkness;-
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> Verily this is the word of a most honourable Messenger,
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> Endued with Power, with rank before the Lord of the Throne,
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> With authority there, (and) faithful to his trust.
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> And (O people!) your companion is not one possessed;
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> And without doubt he saw him in the clear horizon.
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> Neither doth he withhold grudgingly a knowledge of the Unseen.
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> Nor is it the word of an evil spirit accursed.
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> When whither go ye?
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> Verily this is no less than a Message to (all) the Worlds:
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> (With profit) to whoever among you wills to go straight:
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> But ye shall not will except as Allah wills,- the Cherisher of the Worlds.
