<h1>Surah 83. Defrauding, The Cheats, Cheating</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> Woe to those that deal in fraud,-
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> Those who, when they have to receive by measure from men, exact full measure,
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> But when they have to give by measure or weight to men, give less than due.
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> Do they not think that they will be called to account?-
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> On a Mighty Day,
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> A Day when (all) mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds?
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Day! Surely the record of the wicked is (preserved) in Sijjin.
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> And what will explain to thee what Sijjin is?
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> (There is) a Register (fully) inscribed.
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> Woe, that Day, to those that deny-
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> Those that deny the Day of Judgment.
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> And none can deny it but the Transgressor beyond bounds the Sinner!
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> When Our Signs are rehearsed to him, he says, "Tales of the ancients!"
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> By no means! but on their hearts is the stain of the (ill) which they do!
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> Verily, from (the Light of) their Lord, that Day, will they be veiled.
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> Further, they will enter the Fire of Hell.
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> Further, it will be said to them: "This is the (reality) which ye rejected as false!
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> Day, verily the record of the Righteous is (preserved) in 'Illiyin.
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> And what will explain to thee what 'Illiyun is?
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> (There is) a Register (fully) inscribed,
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> To which bear witness those Nearest (to Allah..
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> Truly the Righteous will be in Bliss:
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> On Thrones (of Dignity) will they command a sight (of all things):
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> Thou wilt recognise in their faces the beaming brightness of Bliss.
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> Their thirst will be slaked with Pure Wine sealed:
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> The seal thereof will be Musk: And for this let those aspire, who have aspirations:
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> With it will be (given) a mixture of Tasnim:
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> A spring, from (the waters) whereof drink those Nearest to Allah.
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> Those in sin used to laugh at those who believed,
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> And whenever they passed by them, used to wink at each other (in mockery);
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> And when they returned to their own people, they would return jesting;
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> And whenever they saw them, they would say, "Behold! These are the people truly astray!"
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> But they had not been sent as keepers over them!
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> But on this Day the Believers will laugh at the Unbelievers:
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> On Thrones (of Dignity) they will command (a sight) (of all things).
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> Will not the Unbelievers have been paid back for what they did?
