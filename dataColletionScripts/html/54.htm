<title>54. The Moon</title>
<h1>Surah 54. The Moon</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> The Hour (of Judgment) is nigh, and the moon is cleft asunder.
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> But if they see a Sign, they turn away, and say, "This is (but) transient magic."
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> They reject (the warning) and follow their (own) lusts but every matter has its appointed time.
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> There have already come to them Recitals wherein there is (enough) to check (them),
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> Mature wisdom;- but (the preaching of) Warners profits them not.
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> Therefore, (O Prophet,) turn away from them. The Day that the Caller will call (them) to a terrible affair,
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> They will come forth,- their eyes humbled - from (their) graves, (torpid) like locusts scattered abroad,
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> Hastening, with eyes transfixed, towards the Caller!- "Hard is this Day!", the Unbelievers will say.
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> Before them the People of Noah rejected (their apostle): they rejected Our servant, and said, "Here is one possessed!", and he was driven out.
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> Then he called on his Lord: "I am one overcome: do Thou then help (me)!"
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> So We opened the gates of heaven, with water pouring forth.
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> And We caused the earth to gush forth with springs, so the waters met (and rose) to the extent decreed.
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> But We bore him on an (Ark) made of broad planks and caulked with palm- fibre:
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> She floats under our eyes (and care): a recompense to one who had been rejected (with scorn)!
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> And We have left this as a Sign (for all time): then is there any that will receive admonition?
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> But how (terrible) was My Penalty and My Warning?
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition?
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> The 'Ad (people) (too) rejected (Truth): then how terrible was My Penalty and My Warning?
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> For We sent against them a furious wind, on a Day of violent Disaster,
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> Plucking out men as if they were roots of palm-trees torn up (from the ground).
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> Yea, how (terrible) was My Penalty and My Warning!
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> But We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition?
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> The Thamud (also) rejected (their) Warners.
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> For they said: "What! a man! a Solitary one from among ourselves! shall we follow such a one? Truly should we then be straying in mind, and mad!
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> "Is it that the Message is sent to him, of all people amongst us? Nay, he is a liar, an insolent one!"
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> Ah! they will know on the morrow, which is the liar, the insolent one!
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> For We will send the she-camel by way of trial for them. So watch them, (O Salih), and possess thyself in patience!
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> And tell them that the water is to be divided between them: Each one's right to drink being brought forward (by suitable turns).
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> But they called to their companion, and he took a sword in hand, and hamstrung (her).
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> Ah! how (terrible) was My Penalty and My Warning!
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> For We sent against them a single Mighty Blast, and they became like the dry stubble used by one who pens cattle.
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition?
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> The people of Lut rejected (his) warning.
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> We sent against them a violent Tornado with showers of stones, (which destroyed them), except Lut's household: them We delivered by early Dawn,-
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> As a Grace from Us: thus do We reward those who give thanks.
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> And (Lut) did warn them of Our Punishment, but they disputed about the Warning.
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> And they even sought to snatch away his guests from him, but We blinded their eyes. (They heard:) "Now taste ye My Wrath and My Warning."
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> Early on the morrow an abiding Punishment seized them:
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> "So taste ye My Wrath and My Warning."
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition?
<p>
<A NAME="41"><b>41.</b></A> To the People of Pharaoh, too, aforetime, came Warners (from Allah..
<p>
<A NAME="42"><b>42.</b></A> The (people) rejected all Our Signs; but We seized them with such Penalty (as comes) from One Exalted in Power, able to carry out His Will.
<p>
<A NAME="43"><b>43.</b></A> Are your Unbelievers, (O Quraish), better than they? Or have ye an immunity in the Sacred Books?
<p>
<A NAME="44"><b>44.</b></A> Or do they say: "We acting together can defend ourselves"?
<p>
<A NAME="45"><b>45.</b></A> Soon will their multitude be put to flight, and they will show their backs.
<p>
<A NAME="46"><b>46.</b></A> Nay, the Hour (of Judgment) is the time promised them (for their full recompense): And that Hour will be most grievous and most bitter.
<p>
<A NAME="47"><b>47.</b></A> Truly those in sin are the ones straying in mind, and mad.
<p>
<A NAME="48"><b>48.</b></A> The Day they will be dragged through the Fire on their faces, (they will hear:) "Taste ye the touch of Hell!"
<p>
<A NAME="49"><b>49.</b></A> Verily, all things have We created in proportion and measure.
<p>
<A NAME="50"><b>50.</b></A> And Our Command is but a single (Act),- like the twinkling of an eye.
<p>
<A NAME="51"><b>51.</b></A> And (oft) in the past, have We destroyed gangs like unto you: then is there any that will receive admonition?
<p>
<A NAME="52"><b>52.</b></A> All that they do is noted in (their) Books (of Deeds):
<p>
<A NAME="53"><b>53.</b></A> Every matter, small and great, is on record.
<p>
<A NAME="54"><b>54.</b></A> As to the Righteous, they will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers,
<p>
<A NAME="55"><b>55.</b></A> In an Assembly of Truth, in the Presence of a Sovereign Omnipotent.
