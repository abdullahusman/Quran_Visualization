<h1>Surah 50. Qaf, (the Letter), ( Q )</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> Qaf: By the Glorious Qur'an (Thou art Allah.s Messenger..
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> But they wonder that there has come to them a Warner from among themselves. So the Unbelievers say: "This is a wonderful thing!
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> "What! When we die and become dust, (shall we live again?) That is a (sort of) return far (from our understanding)."
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> We already know how much of them the earth takes away: With Us is a record guarding (the full account).
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> But they deny the Truth when it comes to them: so they are in a confused state.
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> Do they not look at the sky above them?- How We have made it and adorned it, and there are no flaws in it?
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> And the earth- We have spread it out, and set thereon mountains standing firm, and produced therein every kind of beautiful growth (in pairs)-
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> To be observed and commemorated by every devotee turning (to Allah..
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> And We send down from the sky rain charted with blessing, and We produce therewith gardens and Grain for harvests;
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> And tall (and stately) palm-trees, with shoots of fruit-stalks, piled one over another;-
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> As sustenance for ((Allah)'s) Servants;- and We give (new) life therewith to land that is dead: Thus will be the Resurrection.
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> Before them was denied (the Hereafter) by the People of Noah, the Companions of the Rass, the Thamud,
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> The 'Ad, Pharaoh, the brethren of Lut,
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> The Companions of the Wood, and the People of Tubba'; each one (of them) rejected the apostles, and My warning was duly fulfilled (in them).
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> Were We then weary with the first Creation, that they should be in confused doubt about a new Creation?
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> It was We Who created man, and We know what dark suggestions his soul makes to him: for We are nearer to him than (his) jugular vein.
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> Behold, two (guardian angels) appointed to learn (his doings) learn (and noted them), one sitting on the right and one on the left.
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> Not a word does he utter but there is a sentinel by him, ready (to note it).
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> And the stupor of death will bring Truth (before his eyes): "This was the thing which thou wast trying to escape!"
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> And the Trumpet shall be blown: that will be the Day whereof Warning (had been given).
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> And there will come forth every soul: with each will be an (angel) to drive, and an (angel) to bear witness.
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> (It will be said:) "Thou wast heedless of this; now have We removed thy veil, and sharp is thy sight this Day!"
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> And his Companion will say: "Here is (his Record) ready with me!"
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> (The sentence will be:) "Throw, throw into Hell every contumacious Rejecter (of Allah.!-
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> "Who forbade what was good, transgressed all bounds, cast doubts and suspicions;
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> "Who set up another god beside Allah. Throw him into a severe penalty."
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> His Companion will say: "Our Lord! I did not make him transgress, but he was (himself) far astray."
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> He will say: "Dispute not with each other in My Presence: I had already in advance sent you Warning.
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> "The Word changes not before Me, and I do not the least injustice to My Servants."
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> One Day We will ask Hell, "Art thou filled to the full?" It will say, "Are there any more (to come)?"
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> And the Garden will be brought nigh to the Righteous,- no more a thing distant.
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> (A voice will say:) "This is what was promised for you,- for every one who turned (to Allah. in sincere repentance, who kept (His Law),
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> "Who feared ((Allah)) Most Gracious Unseen, and brought a heart turned in devotion (to Him):
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> "Enter ye therein in Peace and Security; this is a Day of Eternal Life!"
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> There will be for them therein all that they wish,- and more besides in Our Presence.
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> But how many generations before them did We destroy (for their sins),- stronger in power than they? Then did they wander through the land: was there any place of escape (for them)?
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> Verily in this is a Message for any that has a heart and understanding or who gives ear and earnestly witnesses (the truth).
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in Six Days, nor did any sense of weariness touch Us.
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> Bear, then, with patience, all that they say, and celebrate the praises of thy Lord, before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting.
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> And during part of the night, (also,) celebrate His praises, and (so likewise) after the postures of adoration.
<p>
<A NAME="41"><b>41.</b></A> And listen for the Day when the Caller will call out from a place quiet near,-
<p>
<A NAME="42"><b>42.</b></A> The Day when they will hear a (mighty) Blast in (very) truth: that will be the Day of Resurrection.
<p>
<A NAME="43"><b>43.</b></A> Verily it is We Who give Life and Death; and to Us is the Final Goal-
<p>
<A NAME="44"><b>44.</b></A> The Day when the Earth will be rent asunder, from (men) hurrying out: that will be a gathering together,- quite easy for Us.
<p>
<A NAME="45"><b>45.</b></A> We know best what they say; and thou art not one to overawe them by force. So admonish with the Qur'an such as fear My Warning!
