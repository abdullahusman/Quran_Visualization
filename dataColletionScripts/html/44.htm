<title>44. Smoke</title>
<h1>Surah 44. Smoke</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> Ha-Mim.
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> By the Book that makes things clear;-
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> We sent it down during a Blessed Night: for We (ever) wish to warn (against Evil).
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> In the (Night) is made distinct every affair of wisdom,
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> By command, from Our Presence. For We (ever) send (revelations),
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> As Mercy from thy Lord: for He hears and knows (all things);
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all between them, if ye (but) have an assured faith.
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> There is no god but He: It is He Who gives life and gives death,- The Lord and Cherisher to you and your earliest ancestors.
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> Yet they play about in doubt.
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> Then watch thou for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke (or mist) plainly visible,
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> Enveloping the people: this will be a Penalty Grievous.
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> (They will say:) "Our Lord! remove the Penalty from us, for we do really believe!"
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> How shall the message be (effectual) for them, seeing that an Messenger explaining things clearly has (already) come to them,-
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> Yet they turn away from him and say: "Tutored (by others), a man possessed!"
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> We shall indeed remove the Penalty for a while, (but) truly ye will revert (to your ways).
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> One day We shall seize you with a mighty onslaught: We will indeed (then) exact Retribution!
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> We did, before them, try the people of Pharaoh: there came to them an apostle most honourable,
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> Saying: "Restore to me the Servants of Allah. I am to you an apostle worthy of all trust;
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> "And be not arrogant as against Allah. for I come to you with authority manifest.
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> "For me, I have sought safety with my Lord and your Lord, against your injuring me.
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> "If ye believe me not, at least keep yourselves away from me."
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> (But they were aggressive:) then he cried to his Lord: "These are indeed a people given to sin."
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> (The reply came:) "March forth with My Servants by night: for ye are sure to be pursued.
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> "And leave the sea as a furrow (divided): for they are a host (destined) to be drowned."
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> How many were the gardens and springs they left behind,
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> And corn-fields and noble buildings,
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> And wealth (and conveniences of life), wherein they had taken such delight!
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> Thus (was their end)! And We made other people inherit (those things)!
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> And neither heaven nor earth shed a tear over them: nor were they given a respite (again).
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> We did deliver aforetime the Children of Israel from humiliating Punishment,
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> Inflicted by Pharaoh, for he was arrogant (even) among inordinate transgressors.
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> And We chose them aforetime above the nations, knowingly,
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> And granted them Signs in which there was a manifest trial
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> As to these (Quraish), they say forsooth:
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> "There is nothing beyond our first death, and we shall not be raised again.
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> "Then bring (back) our forefathers, if what ye say is true!"
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> What! Are they better than the people of Tubba and those who were before them? We destroyed them because they were guilty of sin.
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> We created not the heavens, the earth, and all between them, merely in (idle) sport:
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> We created them not except for just ends: but most of them do not understand.
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> Verily the Day of sorting out is the time appointed for all of them,-
<p>
<A NAME="41"><b>41.</b></A> The Day when no protector can avail his client in aught, and no help can they receive,
<p>
<A NAME="42"><b>42.</b></A> Except such as receive Allah.s Mercy: for He is Exalted in Might, Most Merciful.
<p>
<A NAME="43"><b>43.</b></A> Verily the tree of Zaqqum
<p>
<A NAME="44"><b>44.</b></A> Will be the food of the Sinful,-
<p>
<A NAME="45"><b>45.</b></A> Like molten brass; it will boil in their insides.
<p>
<A NAME="46"><b>46.</b></A> Like the boiling of scalding water.
<p>
<A NAME="47"><b>47.</b></A> (A voice will cry: "Seize ye him and drag him into the midst of the Blazing Fire!
<p>
<A NAME="48"><b>48.</b></A> "Then pour over his head the Penalty of Boiling Water,
<p>
<A NAME="49"><b>49.</b></A> "Taste thou (this)! Truly wast thou mighty, full of honour!
<p>
<A NAME="50"><b>50.</b></A> "Truly this is what ye used to doubt!"
<p>
<A NAME="51"><b>51.</b></A> As to the Righteous (they will be) in a position of Security,
<p>
<A NAME="52"><b>52.</b></A> Among Gardens and Springs;
<p>
<A NAME="53"><b>53.</b></A> Dressed in fine silk and in rich brocade, they will face each other;
<p>
<A NAME="54"><b>54.</b></A> So; and We shall join them to Companions with beautiful, big, and lustrous eyes.
<p>
<A NAME="55"><b>55.</b></A> There can they call for every kind of fruit in peace and security;
<p>
<A NAME="56"><b>56.</b></A> Nor will they there taste Death, except the first death; and He will preserve them from the Penalty of the Blazing Fire,-
<p>
<A NAME="57"><b>57.</b></A> As a Bounty from thy Lord! that will be the supreme achievement!
<p>
<A NAME="58"><b>58.</b></A> Verily, We have made this (Qur'an) easy, in thy tongue, in order that they may give heed.
<p>
<A NAME="59"><b>59.</b></A> So wait thou and watch; for they (too) are waiting.
