<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> For We do determine (according to need); for We are the best to determine (things).
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> Ah woe, that Day! to the Rejecters of Truth!
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> Have We not made the earth (as a place) to draw together.
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> The living and the dead,
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> And made therein mountains standing firm, lofty (in stature); and provided for you water sweet (and wholesome)?

<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> (It will be said:) "Depart ye to that which ye used to reject as false!
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> "Depart ye to a Shadow (of smoke ascending) in three columns,
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> "(Which yields) no shade of coolness, and is of no use against the fierce Blaze.
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> "Indeed it throws about sparks (huge) as Forts,
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> "As if there were (a string of) yellow camels (marching swiftly)."
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> That will be a Day when they shall not be able to speak.
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> Nor will it be open to them to put forth pleas.
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> That will be a Day of Sorting out! We shall gather you together and those before (you)!
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> Now, if ye have a trick (or plot), use it against Me!
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
<p>
<A NAME="41"><b>41.</b></A> As to the Righteous, they shall be amidst (cool) shades and springs (of water).
<p>
<A NAME="42"><b>42.</b></A> And (they shall have) fruits,- all they desire.
<p>
<A NAME="43"><b>43.</b></A> "Eat ye and drink ye to your heart's content: for that ye worked (Righteousness).
<p>
<A NAME="44"><b>44.</b></A> Thus do We certainly reward the Doers of Good.
<p>
<A NAME="45"><b>45.</b></A> Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
<p>
<A NAME="46"><b>46.</b></A> (O ye unjust!) Eat ye and enjoy yourselves (but) a little while, for that ye are Sinners.
<p>
<A NAME="47"><b>47.</b></A> Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
<p>
<A NAME="48"><b>48.</b></A> And when it is said to them, "Prostrate yourselves!" they do not so.
<p>
<A NAME="49"><b>49.</b></A> Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
<p>
<A NAME="50"><b>50.</b></A> Then what Message, after that, will they believe in?
