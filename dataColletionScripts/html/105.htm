<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the Companions of the Elephant?
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> Did He not make their treacherous plan go astray?
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> And He sent against them Flights of Birds,
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> Striking them with stones of baked clay.
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> Then did He make them like an empty field of stalks and straw, (of which the corn) has been eaten up.
