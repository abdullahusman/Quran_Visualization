<title>52. The Mount</title>
<h1>Surah 52. The Mount</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> By the Mount (of Revelation);
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> By a Decree inscribed
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> In a Scroll unfolded;
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> By the much-frequented Fane;
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> By the Canopy Raised High;
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> And by the Ocean filled with Swell;-
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Verily, the Doom of thy Lord will indeed come to pass;-
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> There is none can avert it;-
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> On the Day when the firmament will be in dreadful commotion.
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> And the mountains will fly hither and thither.
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> Then woe that Day to those that treat (Truth) as Falsehood;-
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> That play (and paddle) in shallow trifles.
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> That Day shall they be thrust down to the Fire of Hell, irresistibly.
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> "This:, it will be said, "Is the Fire,- which ye were wont to deny!
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> "Is this then a fake, or is it ye that do not see?
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> "Burn ye therein: the same is it to you whether ye bear it with patience, or not: Ye but receive the recompense of your (own) deeds."
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> As to the Righteous, they will be in Gardens, and in Happiness,-
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> Enjoying the (Bliss) which their Lord hath bestowed on them, and their Lord shall deliver them from the Penalty of the Fire.
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> (To them will be said:) "Eat and drink ye, with profit and health, because of your (good) deeds."
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> They will recline (with ease) on Thrones (of dignity) arranged in ranks; and We shall join them to Companions, with beautiful big and lustrous eyes.
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> And those who believe and whose families follow them in Faith,- to them shall We join their families: Nor shall We deprive them (of the fruit) of aught of their works: (Yet) is each individual in pledge for his deeds.
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> And We shall bestow on them, of fruit and meat, anything they shall desire.
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> They shall there exchange, one with another, a (loving) cup free of frivolity, free of all taint of ill.
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> Round about them will serve, (devoted) to them. Youths (handsome) as Pearls well-guarded.
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> They will advance to each other, engaging in mutual enquiry.
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> They will say: "Aforetime, we were not without fear for the sake of our people.
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> "But Allah has been good to us, and has delivered us from the Penalty of the Scorching Wind.
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> "Truly, we did call unto Him from of old: truly it is He, the Beneficent, the Merciful!"
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> Therefore proclaim thou the praises (of thy Lord): for by the Grace of thy Lord, thou art no (vulgar) soothsayer, nor art thou one possessed.
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> Or do they say:- "A Poet! we await for him some calamity (hatched) by Time!"
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> Say thou: "Await ye!- I too will wait along with you!"
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> Is it that their faculties of understanding urge them to this, or are they but a people transgressing beyond bounds?
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> Or do they say, "He fabricated the (Message)"? Nay, they have no faith!
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> Let them then produce a recital like unto it,- If (it be) they speak the truth!
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> Were they created of nothing, or were they themselves the creators?
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, they have no firm belief.
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> Or are the Treasures of thy Lord with them, or are they the managers (of affairs)?
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> Or have they a ladder, by which they can (climb up to heaven and) listen (to its secrets)? Then let (such a) listener of theirs produce a manifest proof.
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> Or has He only daughters and ye have sons?
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> Or is it that thou dost ask for a reward, so that they are burdened with a load of debt?-
<p>
<A NAME="41"><b>41.</b></A> Or that the Unseen in it their hands, and they write it down?
<p>
<A NAME="42"><b>42.</b></A> Or do they intend a plot (against thee)? But those who defy Allah are themselves involved in a Plot!
<p>
<A NAME="43"><b>43.</b></A> Or have they a god other than Allah. Exalted is Allah far above the things they associate with Him!
<p>
<A NAME="44"><b>44.</b></A> Were they to see a piece of the sky falling (on them), they would (only) say: "Clouds gathered in heaps!"
<p>
<A NAME="45"><b>45.</b></A> So leave them alone until they encounter that Day of theirs, wherein they shall (perforce) swoon (with terror),-
<p>
<A NAME="46"><b>46.</b></A> The Day when their plotting will avail them nothing and no help shall be given them.
<p>
<A NAME="47"><b>47.</b></A> And verily, for those who do wrong, there is another punishment besides this: But most of them understand not.
<p>
<A NAME="48"><b>48.</b></A> Now await in patience the command of thy Lord: for verily thou art in Our eyes: and celebrate the praises of thy Lord the while thou standest forth,
<p>
<A NAME="49"><b>49.</b></A> And for part of the night also praise thou Him,- and at the retreat of the stars!
