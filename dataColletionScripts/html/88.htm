<h1>Surah 88. The Overwhelming, The Pall</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> Has the story reached thee of the overwhelming (Event)?
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> Some faces, that Day, will be humiliated,
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> Labouring (hard), weary,-
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> The while they enter the Blazing Fire,-
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> The while they are given, to drink, of a boiling hot spring,
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> No food will there be for them but a bitter Dhari'
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Which will neither nourish nor satisfy hunger.
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> (Other) faces that Day will be joyful,
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> Pleased with their striving,-
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> In a Garden on high,
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> Where they shall hear no (word) of vanity:
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> Therein will be a bubbling spring:
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> Therein will be Thrones (of dignity), raised on high,
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> Goblets placed (ready),
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> And cushions set in rows,
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> And rich carpets (all) spread out.
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> Do they not look at the Camels, how they are made?-
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> And at the Sky, how it is raised high?-
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> And at the Mountains, how they are fixed firm?-
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> And at the Earth, how it is spread out?
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> Therefore do thou give admonition, for thou art one to admonish.
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> Thou art not one to manage (men's) affairs.
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> But if any turn away and reject Allah,-
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> Allah will punish him with a mighty Punishment,
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> For to Us will be their return;
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> Then it will be for Us to call them to account.
