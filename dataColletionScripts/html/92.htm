<title>92. The Night</title>
<h1>Surah 92. The Night</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> By the Night as it conceals (the light);
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> By the Day as it appears in glory;
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> By (the mystery of) the creation of male and female;-
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> Verily, (the ends) ye strive for are diverse.
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> So he who gives (in charity) and fears ((Allah)),
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> And (in all sincerity) testifies to the best,-
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> We will indeed make smooth for him the path to Bliss.
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self-sufficient,
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> And gives the lie to the best,-
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> We will indeed make smooth for him the path to Misery;
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> Nor will his wealth profit him when he falls headlong (into the Pit).
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> Verily We take upon Ourselves to guide,
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> And verily unto Us (belong) the End and the Beginning.
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> Therefore do I warn you of a Fire blazing fiercely;
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> None shall reach it but those most unfortunate ones
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> Who give the lie to Truth and turn their backs.
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> But those most devoted to Allah shall be removed far from it,-
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> Those who spend their wealth for increase in self-purification,
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> And have in their minds no favour from anyone for which a reward is expected in return,
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> But only the desire to seek for the Countenance of their Lord Most High;
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> And soon will they attain (complete) satisfaction.
