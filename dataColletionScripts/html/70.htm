<title>70. The Ascending Stairways, Staircases Upward, Sckeptic</title>
<h1>Surah 70. The Ascending Stairways, Staircases Upward, Sckeptic</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> A questioner asked about a Penalty to befall-
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> The Unbelievers, the which there is none to ward off,-
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> (A Penalty) from Allah, Lord of the Ways of Ascent.
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> The angels and the spirit ascend unto him in a Day the measure whereof is (as) fifty thousand years:
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> Therefore do thou hold Patience,- a Patience of beautiful (contentment).
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> They see the (Day) indeed as a far-off (event):
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> But We see it (quite) near.
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> The Day that the sky will be like molten brass,
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> And the mountains will be like wool,
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> And no friend will ask after a friend,
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> Though they will be put in sight of each other,- the sinner's desire will be: Would that he could redeem himself from the Penalty of that Day by (sacrificing) his children,
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> His wife and his brother,
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> His kindred who sheltered him,
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> And all, all that is on earth,- so it could deliver him:
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> By no means! for it would be the Fire of Hell!-
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> Plucking out (his being) right to the skull!-
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> Inviting (all) such as turn their backs and turn away their faces (from the Right).
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> And collect (wealth) and hide it (from use)!
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> Truly man was created very impatient;-
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> Fretful when evil touches him;
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> And niggardly when good reaches him;-
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> Not so those devoted to Prayer;-
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> Those who remain steadfast to their prayer;
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> And those in whose wealth is a recognised right.
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> For the (needy) who asks and him who is prevented (for some reason from asking);
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> And those who hold to the truth of the Day of Judgment;
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> And those who fear the displeasure of their Lord,-
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> For their Lord's displeasure is the opposite of Peace and Tranquillity;-
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> And those who guard their chastity,
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> Except with their wives and the (captives) whom their right hands possess,- for (then) they are not to be blamed,
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> But those who trespass beyond this are transgressors;-
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> And those who respect their trusts and covenants;
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> And those who stand firm in their testimonies;
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> And those who guard (the sacredness) of their worship;-
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> Such will be the honoured ones in the Gardens (of Bliss).
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> Now what is the matter with the Unbelievers that they rush madly before thee-
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> From the right and from the left, in crowds?
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> Does every man of them long to enter the Garden of Bliss?
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> By no means! For We have created them out of the (base matter) they know!
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> Now I do call to witness the Lord of all points in the East and the West that We can certainly-
<p>
<A NAME="41"><b>41.</b></A> Substitute for them better (men) than they; And We are not to be defeated (in Our Plan).
<p>
<A NAME="42"><b>42.</b></A> So leave them to plunge in vain talk and play about, until they encounter that Day of theirs which they have been promised!-
<p>
<A NAME="43"><b>43.</b></A> The Day whereon they will issue from their sepulchres in sudden haste as if they were rushing to a goal-post (fixed for them),-
<p>
<A NAME="44"><b>44.</b></A> Their eyes lowered in dejection,- ignominy covering them (all over)! such is the Day the which they are promised!
<p>
