<h1>Surah 87. The Most High, Glory To Your Lord In The Highest</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> Glorify the name of thy Guardian-Lord Most High,
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> Who hath created, and further, given order and proportion;
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> Who hath ordained laws. And granted guidance;
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> And Who bringeth out the (green and luscious) pasture,
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> And then doth make it (but) swarthy stubble.
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> By degrees shall We teach thee to declare (the Message), so thou shalt not forget,
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Except as Allah wills: For He knoweth what is manifest and what is hidden.
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> And We will make it easy for thee (to follow) the simple (Path).
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> Therefore give admonition in case the admonition profits (the hearer).
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> The admonition will be received by those who fear ((Allah)):
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> But it will be avoided by those most unfortunate ones,
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> Who will enter the Great Fire,
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> In which they will then neither die nor live.
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> But those will prosper who purify themselves,
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> And glorify the name of their Guardian-Lord, and (lift their hearts) in prayer.
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> Day (behold), ye prefer the life of this world;
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> But the Hereafter is better and more enduring.
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> And this is in the Books of the earliest (Revelation),-
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> The Books of Abraham and Moses.
