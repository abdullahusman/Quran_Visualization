<title>69. The Reality</title>
<h1>Surah 69. The Reality</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> The Sure Reality!
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> What is the Sure Reality?
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> And what will make thee realise what the Sure Reality is?
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> The Thamud and the 'Ad People (branded) as false the Stunning Calamity!
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> But the Thamud,- they were destroyed by a terrible Storm of thunder and lightning!
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> And the 'Ad, they were destroyed by a furious Wind, exceedingly violent;
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> He made it rage against them seven nights and eight days in succession: so that thou couldst see the (whole) people lying prostrate in its (path), as they had been roots of hollow palm-trees tumbled down!
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> Then seest thou any of them left surviving?
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> And Pharaoh, and those before him, and the Cities Overthrown, committed habitual Sin.
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> And disobeyed (each) the apostle of their Lord; so He punished them with an abundant Penalty.
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> We, when the water (of Noah's Flood) overflowed beyond its limits, carried you (mankind), in the floating (Ark),
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> That We might make it a Message unto you, and that ears (that should hear the tale and) retain its memory should bear its (lessons) in remembrance.
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> Then, when one blast is sounded on the Trumpet,
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> And the earth is moved, and its mountains, and they are crushed to powder at one stroke,-
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> On that Day shall the (Great) Event come to pass.
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> And the sky will be rent asunder, for it will that Day be flimsy,
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> And the angels will be on its sides, and eight will, that Day, bear the Throne of thy Lord above them.
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> That Day shall ye be brought to Judgment: not an act of yours that ye hide will be hidden.
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> Then he that will be given his Record in his right hand will say: "Ah here! Read ye my Record!
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> "I did really understand that my Account would (One Day) reach me!"
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> And he will be in a life of Bliss,
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> In a Garden on high,
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> The Fruits whereof (will hang in bunches) low and near.
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> "Eat ye and drink ye, with full satisfaction; because of the (good) that ye sent before you, in the days that are gone!"
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> And he that will be given his Record in his left hand, will say: "Ah! Would that my Record had not been given to me!
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> "And that I had never realised how my account (stood)!
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> "Ah! Would that (Death) had made an end of me!
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> "Of no profit to me has been my wealth!
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> "My power has perished from me!"...
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> (The stern command will say): "Seize ye him, and bind ye him,
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> "And burn ye him in the Blazing Fire.
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> "Further, make him march in a chain, whereof the length is seventy cubits!
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> "This was he that would not believe in Allah Most High.
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> "And would not encourage the feeding of the indigent!
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> "So no friend hath he here this Day.
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> "Nor hath he any food except the corruption from the washing of wounds,
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> "Which none do eat but those in sin."
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> So I do call to witness what ye see,
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> And what ye see not,
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> That this is verily the word of an honoured apostle;
<p>
<A NAME="41"><b>41.</b></A> It is not the word of a poet: little it is ye believe!
<p>
<A NAME="42"><b>42.</b></A> Nor is it the word of a soothsayer: little admonition it is ye receive.
<p>
<A NAME="43"><b>43.</b></A> (This is) a Message sent down from the Lord of the Worlds.
<p>
<A NAME="44"><b>44.</b></A> And if the apostle were to invent any sayings in Our name,
<p>
<A NAME="45"><b>45.</b></A> We should certainly seize him by his right hand,
<p>
<A NAME="46"><b>46.</b></A> And We should certainly then cut off the artery of his heart:
<p>
<A NAME="47"><b>47.</b></A> Nor could any of you withhold him (from Our wrath).
<p>
<A NAME="48"><b>48.</b></A> But verily this is a Message for the Allah.fearing.
<p>
<A NAME="49"><b>49.</b></A> And We certainly know that there are amongst you those that reject (it).
<p>
<A NAME="50"><b>50.</b></A> But truly (Revelation) is a cause of sorrow for the Unbelievers.
<p>
<A NAME="51"><b>51.</b></A> But verily it is Truth of assured certainty.
<p>
<A NAME="52"><b>52.</b></A> So glorify the name of thy Lord Most High.
