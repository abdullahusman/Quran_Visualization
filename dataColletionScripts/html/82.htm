<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> When the Stars are scattered;
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> When the Oceans are suffered to burst forth;
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> And when the Graves are turned upside down;-
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> (Then) shall each soul know what it hath sent forward and (what it hath) kept back.
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> O man! What has seduced thee from thy Lord Most Beneficent?-
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Him Who created thee. Fashioned thee in due proportion, and gave thee a just bias;
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> In whatever Form He wills, does He put thee together.
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> Nay! but ye do reject Right and Judgment!
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> But verily over you (are appointed angels) to protect you,-
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> Kind and honourable,- Writing down (your deeds):
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> They know (and understand) all that ye do.

<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> As for the Righteous, they will be in bliss;
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> And the Wicked - they will be in the Fire,
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> Which they will enter on the Day of Judgment,
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> And they will not be able to keep away therefrom.
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> And what will explain to thee what the Day of Judgment is?
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> Again, what will explain to thee what the Day of Judgment is?
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> (It will be) the Day when no soul shall have power (to do) aught for another: For the command, that Day, will be (wholly) with Allah.
