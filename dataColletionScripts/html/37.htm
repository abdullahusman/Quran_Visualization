<title>37. Those Who Set The Ranks, Drawn Up In Ranks</title>
<h1>Surah 37. Those Who Set The Ranks, Drawn Up In Ranks</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> By those who range themselves in ranks,
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> And so are strong in repelling (evil),
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> And thus proclaim the Message (of Allah.!
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> Verily, verily, your Allah is one!-
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> Lord of the heavens and of the earth and all between them, and Lord of every point at the rising of the sun!
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> We have indeed decked the lower heaven with beauty (in) the stars,-
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> (For beauty) and for guard against all obstinate rebellious evil spirits,
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> (So) they should not strain their ears in the direction of the Exalted Assembly but be cast away from every side,
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> Repulsed, for they are under a perpetual penalty,
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> Except such as snatch away something by stealth, and they are pursued by a flaming fire, of piercing brightness.
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> Just ask their opinion: are they the more difficult to create, or the (other) beings We have created? Them have We created out of a sticky clay!
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> Truly dost thou marvel, while they ridicule,
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> And, when they are admonished, pay no heed,-
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> And, when they see a Sign, turn it to mockery,
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> And say, "This is nothing but evident sorcery!
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> "What! when we die, and become dust and bones, shall we (then) be raised up (again)
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> "And also our fathers of old?"
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> Say thou: "Yea, and ye shall then be humiliated (on account of your evil)."
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> Then it will be a single (compelling) cry; and behold, they will begin to see!
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> They will say, "Ah! Woe to us! This is the Day of Judgment!"
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> (A voice will say,) "This is the Day of Sorting Out, whose truth ye (once) denied!"
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> "Bring ye up", it shall be said, "The wrong-doers and their wives, and the things they worshipped-
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> "Besides Allah, and lead them to the Way to the (Fierce) Fire!
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> "But stop them, for they must be asked:
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> "'What is the matter with you that ye help not each other?'"
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> Nay, but that day they shall submit (to Judgment);
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> And they will turn to one another, and question one another.
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> They will say: "It was ye who used to come to us from the right hand (of power and authority)!"
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> They will reply: "Nay, ye yourselves had no Faith!
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> "Nor had we any authority over you. Nay, it was ye who were a people in obstinate rebellion!
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> "So now has been proved true, against us, the word of our Lord that we shall indeed (have to) taste (the punishment of our sins).
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> "We led you astray: for truly we were ourselves astray."
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> Truly, that Day, they will (all) share in the Penalty.
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> Verily that is how We shall deal with Sinners.
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> For they, when they were told that there is no god except Allah, would puff themselves up with Pride,
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> And say: "What! shall we give up our gods for the sake of a Poet possessed?"
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> Nay! he has come with the (very) Truth, and he confirms (the Message of) the apostles (before him).
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> Ye shall indeed taste of the Grievous Penalty;-
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> But it will be no more than the retribution of (the Evil) that ye have wrought;-
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> But the sincere (and devoted) Servants of Allah,-
<p>
<A NAME="41"><b>41.</b></A> For them is a Sustenance determined,
<p>
<A NAME="42"><b>42.</b></A> Fruits (Delights); and they (shall enjoy) honour and dignity,
<p>
<A NAME="43"><b>43.</b></A> In Gardens of Felicity,
<p>
<A NAME="44"><b>44.</b></A> Facing each other on Thrones (of Dignity):
<p>
<A NAME="45"><b>45.</b></A> Round will be passed to them a Cup from a clear-flowing fountain,
<p>
<A NAME="46"><b>46.</b></A> Crystal-white, of a taste delicious to those who drink (thereof),
<p>
<A NAME="47"><b>47.</b></A> Free from headiness; nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.
<p>
<A NAME="48"><b>48.</b></A> And besides them will be chaste women, restraining their glances, with big eyes (of wonder and beauty).
<p>
<A NAME="49"><b>49.</b></A> As if they were (delicate) eggs closely guarded.
<p>
<A NAME="50"><b>50.</b></A> Then they will turn to one another and question one another.
<p>
<A NAME="51"><b>51.</b></A> One of them will start the talk and say: "I had an intimate companion (on the earth),
<p>
<A NAME="52"><b>52.</b></A> "Who used to say, 'what! art thou amongst those who bear witness to the Truth (of the Message)?
<p>
<A NAME="53"><b>53.</b></A> "'When we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed receive rewards and punishments?'"
<p>
<A NAME="54"><b>54.</b></A> (A voice) said: "Would ye like to look down?"
<p>
<A NAME="55"><b>55.</b></A> He looked down and saw him in the midst of the Fire.
<p>
<A NAME="56"><b>56.</b></A> He said: "By Allah. thou wast little short of bringing me to perdition!
<p>
<A NAME="57"><b>57.</b></A> "Had it not been for the Grace of my Lord, I should certainly have been among those brought (there)!
<p>
<A NAME="58"><b>58.</b></A> "Is it (the case) that we shall not die,
<p>
<A NAME="59"><b>59.</b></A> "Except our first death, and that we shall not be punished?"
<p>
<A NAME="60"><b>60.</b></A> Verily this is the supreme achievement!
<p>
<A NAME="61"><b>61.</b></A> For the like of this let all strive, who wish to strive.
<p>
<A NAME="62"><b>62.</b></A> Is that the better entertainment or the Tree of Zaqqum?
<p>
<A NAME="63"><b>63.</b></A> For We have truly made it (as) a trial for the wrong-doers.
<p>
<A NAME="64"><b>64.</b></A> For it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-Fire:
<p>
<A NAME="65"><b>65.</b></A> The shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of devils:
<p>
<A NAME="66"><b>66.</b></A> Truly they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith.
<p>
<A NAME="67"><b>67.</b></A> Then on top of that they will be given a mixture made of boiling water.
<p>
<A NAME="68"><b>68.</b></A> Then shall their return be to the (Blazing) Fire.
<p>
<A NAME="69"><b>69.</b></A> Truly they found their fathers on the wrong Path;
<p>
<A NAME="70"><b>70.</b></A> So they (too) were rushed down on their footsteps!
<p>
<A NAME="71"><b>71.</b></A> And truly before them, many of the ancients went astray;-
<p>
<A NAME="72"><b>72.</b></A> But We sent aforetime, among them, (apostles) to admonish them;-
<p>
<A NAME="73"><b>73.</b></A> Then see what was the end of those who were admonished (but heeded not),-
<p>
<A NAME="74"><b>74.</b></A> Except the sincere (and devoted) Servants of Allah.
<p>
<A NAME="75"><b>75.</b></A> (In the days of old), Noah cried to Us, and We are the best to hear prayer.
<p>
<A NAME="76"><b>76.</b></A> And We delivered him and his people from the Great Calamity,
<p>
<A NAME="77"><b>77.</b></A> And made his progeny to endure (on this earth);
<p>
<A NAME="78"><b>78.</b></A> And We left (this blessing) for him among generations to come in later times:
<p>
<A NAME="79"><b>79.</b></A> "Peace and salutation to Noah among the nations!"
<p>
<A NAME="80"><b>80.</b></A> Thus indeed do we reward those who do right.
<p>
<A NAME="81"><b>81.</b></A> For he was one of our believing Servants.
<p>
<A NAME="82"><b>82.</b></A> Then the rest we overwhelmed in the Flood.
<p>
<A NAME="83"><b>83.</b></A> Verily among those who followed his Way was Abraham.
<p>
<A NAME="84"><b>84.</b></A> Behold! he approached his Lord with a sound heart.
<p>
<A NAME="85"><b>85.</b></A> Behold! he said to his father and to his people, "What is that which ye worship?
<p>
<A NAME="86"><b>86.</b></A> "Is it a falsehood- gods other than Allah. that ye desire?
<p>
<A NAME="87"><b>87.</b></A> "Then what is your idea about the Lord of the worlds?"
<p>
<A NAME="88"><b>88.</b></A> Then did he cast a glance at the Stars.
<p>
<A NAME="89"><b>89.</b></A> And he said, "I am indeed sick (at heart)!"
<p>
<A NAME="90"><b>90.</b></A> So they turned away from him, and departed.
<p>
<A NAME="91"><b>91.</b></A> Then did he turn to their gods and said, "will ye not eat (of the offerings before you)?...
<p>
<A NAME="92"><b>92.</b></A> "What is the matter with you that ye speak not (intelligently)?"
<p>
<A NAME="93"><b>93.</b></A> Then did he turn upon them, striking (them) with the right hand.
<p>
<A NAME="94"><b>94.</b></A> Then came (the worshippers) with hurried steps, and faced (him).
<p>
<A NAME="95"><b>95.</b></A> He said: "Worship ye that which ye have (yourselves) carved?
<p>
<A NAME="96"><b>96.</b></A> "But Allah has created you and your handwork!"
<p>
<A NAME="97"><b>97.</b></A> They said, "Build him a furnace, and throw him into the blazing fire!"
<p>
<A NAME="98"><b>98.</b></A> (This failing), they then sought a stratagem against him, but We made them the ones most humiliated!
<p>
<A NAME="99"><b>99.</b></A> He said: "I will go to my Lord! He will surely guide me!
<p>
<A NAME="100"><b>100.</b></A> "O my Lord! Grant me a righteous (son)!"
<p>
<A NAME="101"><b>101.</b></A> So We gave him the good news of a boy ready to suffer and forbear.
<p>
<A NAME="102"><b>102.</b></A> Then, when (the son) reached (the age of) (serious) work with him, he said: "O my son! I see in vision that I offer thee in sacrifice: Now see what is thy view!" (The son) said: "O my father! Do as thou art commanded: thou will find me, if Allah so wills one practising Patience and Constancy!"
<p>
<A NAME="103"><b>103.</b></A> So when they had both submitted their wills (to Allah., and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (for sacrifice),
<p>
<A NAME="104"><b>104.</b></A> We called out to him "O Abraham!
<p>
<A NAME="105"><b>105.</b></A> "Thou hast already fulfilled the vision!" - thus indeed do We reward those who do right.
<p>
<A NAME="106"><b>106.</b></A> For this was obviously a trial-
<p>
<A NAME="107"><b>107.</b></A> And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice:
<p>
<A NAME="108"><b>108.</b></A> And We left (this blessing) for him among generations (to come) in later times:
<p>
<A NAME="109"><b>109.</b></A> "Peace and salutation to Abraham!"
<p>
<A NAME="110"><b>110.</b></A> Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.
<p>
<A NAME="111"><b>111.</b></A> For he was one of our believing Servants.
<p>
<A NAME="112"><b>112.</b></A> And We gave him the good news of Isaac - a prophet,- one of the Righteous.
<p>
<A NAME="113"><b>113.</b></A> We blessed him and Isaac: but of their progeny are (some) that do right, and (some) that obviously do wrong, to their own souls.
<p>
<A NAME="114"><b>114.</b></A> Again (of old) We bestowed Our favour on Moses and Aaron,
<p>
<A NAME="115"><b>115.</b></A> And We delivered them and their people from (their) Great Calamity;
<p>
<A NAME="116"><b>116.</b></A> And We helped them, so they overcame (their troubles);
<p>
<A NAME="117"><b>117.</b></A> And We gave them the Book which helps to make things clear;
<p>
<A NAME="118"><b>118.</b></A> And We guided them to the Straight Way.
<p>
<A NAME="119"><b>119.</b></A> And We left (this blessing) for them among generations (to come) in later times:
<p>
<A NAME="120"><b>120.</b></A> "Peace and salutation to Moses and Aaron!"
<p>
<A NAME="121"><b>121.</b></A> Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.
<p>
<A NAME="122"><b>122.</b></A> For they were two of our believing Servants.
<p>
<A NAME="123"><b>123.</b></A> So also was Elias among those sent (by Us).
<p>
<A NAME="124"><b>124.</b></A> Behold, he said to his people, "Will ye not fear ((Allah))?
<p>
<A NAME="125"><b>125.</b></A> "Will ye call upon Baal and forsake the Best of Creators,-
<p>
<A NAME="126"><b>126.</b></A> "(Allah), your Lord and Cherisher and the Lord and Cherisher of your fathers of old?"
<p>
<A NAME="127"><b>127.</b></A> But they rejected him, and they will certainly be called up (for punishment),-
<p>
<A NAME="128"><b>128.</b></A> Except the sincere and devoted Servants of Allah (among them).
<p>
<A NAME="129"><b>129.</b></A> And We left (this blessing) for him among generations (to come) in later times:
<p>
<A NAME="130"><b>130.</b></A> "Peace and salutation to such as Elias!"
<p>
<A NAME="131"><b>131.</b></A> Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.
<p>
<A NAME="132"><b>132.</b></A> For he was one of our believing Servants.
<p>
<A NAME="133"><b>133.</b></A> So also was Lut among those sent (by Us).
<p>
<A NAME="134"><b>134.</b></A> Behold, We delivered him and his adherents, all
<p>
<A NAME="135"><b>135.</b></A> Except an old woman who was among those who lagged behind:
<p>
<A NAME="136"><b>136.</b></A> Then We destroyed the rest.
<p>
<A NAME="137"><b>137.</b></A> Verily, ye pass by their (sites), by day-
<p>
<A NAME="138"><b>138.</b></A> And by night: will ye not understand?
<p>
<A NAME="139"><b>139.</b></A> So also was Jonah among those sent (by Us).
<p>
<A NAME="140"><b>140.</b></A> When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden,
<p>
<A NAME="141"><b>141.</b></A> He (agreed to) cast lots, and he was condemned:
<p>
<A NAME="142"><b>142.</b></A> Then the big Fish did swallow him, and he had done acts worthy of blame.
<p>
<A NAME="143"><b>143.</b></A> Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified Allah,
<p>
<A NAME="144"><b>144.</b></A> He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the Day of Resurrection.
<p>
<A NAME="145"><b>145.</b></A> But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness,
<p>
<A NAME="146"><b>146.</b></A> And We caused to grow, over him, a spreading plant of the gourd kind.
<p>
<A NAME="147"><b>147.</b></A> And We sent him (on a mission) to a hundred thousand (men) or more.
<p>
<A NAME="148"><b>148.</b></A> And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.
<p>
<A NAME="149"><b>149.</b></A> Now ask them their opinion: Is it that thy Lord has (only) daughters, and they have sons?-
<p>
<A NAME="150"><b>150.</b></A> Or that We created the angels female, and they are witnesses (thereto)?
<p>
<A NAME="151"><b>151.</b></A> Is it not that they say, from their own invention,
<p>
<A NAME="152"><b>152.</b></A> "(Allah) has begotten children"? but they are liars!
<p>
<A NAME="153"><b>153.</b></A> Did He (then) choose daughters rather than sons?
<p>
<A NAME="154"><b>154.</b></A> What is the matter with you? How judge ye?
<p>
<A NAME="155"><b>155.</b></A> Will ye not then receive admonition?
<p>
<A NAME="156"><b>156.</b></A> Or have ye an authority manifest?
<p>
<A NAME="157"><b>157.</b></A> Then bring ye your Book (of authority) if ye be truthful!
<p>
<A NAME="158"><b>158.</b></A> And they have invented a blood-relationship between Him and the Jinns: but the Jinns know (quite well) that they have indeed to appear (before his Judgment- Seat)!
<p>
<A NAME="159"><b>159.</b></A> Glory to Allah. (He is free) from the things they ascribe (to Him)!
<p>
<A NAME="160"><b>160.</b></A> Not (so do) the Servants of Allah, sincere and devoted.
<p>
<A NAME="161"><b>161.</b></A> For, verily, neither ye nor those ye worship-
<p>
<A NAME="162"><b>162.</b></A> Can lead (any) into temptation concerning Allah,
<p>
<A NAME="163"><b>163.</b></A> Except such as are (themselves) going to the blazing Fire!
<p>
<A NAME="164"><b>164.</b></A> (Those ranged in ranks say): "Not one of us but has a place appointed;
<p>
<A NAME="165"><b>165.</b></A> "And we are verily ranged in ranks (for service);
<p>
<A NAME="166"><b>166.</b></A> "And we are verily those who declare ((Allah)'s) glory!"
<p>
<A NAME="167"><b>167.</b></A> And there were those who said,
<p>
<A NAME="168"><b>168.</b></A> "If only we had had before us a Message from those of old,
<p>
<A NAME="169"><b>169.</b></A> "We should certainly have been Servants of Allah, sincere (and devoted)!"
<p>
<A NAME="170"><b>170.</b></A> But (now that the Qur'an has come), they reject it: But soon will they know!
<p>
<A NAME="171"><b>171.</b></A> Already has Our Word been passed before (this) to our Servants sent (by Us),
<p>
<A NAME="172"><b>172.</b></A> That they would certainly be assisted,
<p>
<A NAME="173"><b>173.</b></A> And that Our forces,- they surely must conquer.
<p>
<A NAME="174"><b>174.</b></A> So turn thou away from them for a little while,
<p>
<A NAME="175"><b>175.</b></A> And watch them (how they fare), and they soon shall see (how thou farest)!
<p>
<A NAME="176"><b>176.</b></A> Do they wish (indeed) to hurry on our Punishment?
<p>
<A NAME="177"><b>177.</b></A> But when it descends into the open space before them, evil will be the morning for those who were warned (and heeded not)!
<p>
<A NAME="178"><b>178.</b></A> So turn thou away from them for a little while,
<p>
<A NAME="179"><b>179.</b></A> And watch (how they fare) and they soon shall see (how thou farest)!
<p>
<A NAME="180"><b>180.</b></A> Glory to thy Lord, the Lord of Honour and Power! (He is free) from what they ascribe (to Him)!
<p>
<A NAME="181"><b>181.</b></A> And Peace on the apostles!
<p>
<A NAME="182"><b>182.</b></A> And Praise to Allah, the Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds.
