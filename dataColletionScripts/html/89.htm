<h1>Surah 89. The Dawn, Daybreak</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> By the break of Day
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> By the Nights twice five;
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> By the even and odd (contrasted);
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> And by the Night when it passeth away;-
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> Is there (not) in these an adjuration (or evidence) for those who understand?
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the 'Ad (people),-
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Of the (city of) Iram, with lofty pillars,
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> The like of which were not produced in (all) the land?
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> And with the Thamud (people), who cut out (huge) rocks in the valley?-
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> And with Pharaoh, lord of stakes?
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> (All) these transgressed beyond bounds in the lands,
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> And heaped therein mischief (on mischief).
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> Therefore did thy Lord pour on them a scourge of diverse chastisements:
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> For thy Lord is (as a Guardian) on a watch-tower.
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> Now, as for man, when his Lord trieth him, giving him honour and gifts, then saith he, (puffed up), "My Lord hath honoured me."
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> But when He trieth him, restricting his subsistence for him, then saith he (in despair), "My Lord hath humiliated me!"
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> Nay, nay! but ye honour not the orphans!
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> Nor do ye encourage one another to feed the poor!-
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> And ye devour inheritance - all with greed,
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> And ye love wealth with inordinate love!
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> Nay! When the earth is pounded to powder,
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> And thy Lord cometh, and His angels, rank upon rank,
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> And Hell, that Day, is brought (face to face),- on that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance profit him?
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> He will say: "Ah! Would that I had sent forth (good deeds) for (this) my (Future) Life!"
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> For, that Day, His Chastisement will be such as none (else) can inflict,
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> And His bonds will be such as none (other) can bind.
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> (To the righteous soul will be said:) "O (thou) soul, in (complete) rest and satisfaction!
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> "Come back thou to thy Lord,- well pleased (thyself), and well-pleasing unto Him!
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> "Enter thou, then, among My devotees!
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> "Yea, enter thou My Heaven!
