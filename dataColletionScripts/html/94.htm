<h1>Surah 94. Solace, Consolation, Relief</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> Have We not expanded thee thy breast?-
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> And removed from thee thy burden
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> The which did gall thy back?-
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> And raised high the esteem (in which) thou (art held)?
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> So, verily, with every difficulty, there is relief:
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> Verily, with every difficulty there is relief.
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Therefore, when thou art free (from thine immediate task), still labour hard,
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> And to thy Lord turn (all) thy attention.
