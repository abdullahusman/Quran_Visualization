<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> Those who reject (Truth), among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists, were not going to depart (from their ways) until there should come to them Clear Evidence,-
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> An apostle from Allah, rehearsing scriptures kept pure and holy:
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> Wherein are laws (or decrees) right and straight.
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> Nor did the People of the Book make schisms, until after there came to them Clear Evidence.
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> And they have been commanded no more than this: To worship Allah, offering Him sincere devotion, being true (in faith); to establish regular prayer; and to practise regular charity; and that is the Religion Right and Straight.
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> Those who reject (Truth), among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists, will be in Hell-Fire, to dwell therein (for aye). They are the worst of creatures.
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Those who have faith and do righteous deeds,- they are the best of creatures.
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> Their reward is with Allah. Gardens of Eternity, beneath which rivers flow; they will dwell therein for ever; Allah well pleased with them, and they with Him: all this for such as fear their Lord and Cherisher.
