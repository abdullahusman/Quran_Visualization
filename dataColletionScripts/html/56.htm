<h1>Surah 56. The Event, The Inevitable</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> When the Event inevitable cometh to pass,
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> Then will no (soul) entertain falsehood concerning its coming.
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> (Many) will it bring low; (many) will it exalt;
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> When the earth shall be shaken to its depths,
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> And the mountains shall be crumbled to atoms,
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> Becoming dust scattered abroad,
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> And ye shall be sorted out into three classes.
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> Then (there will be) the Companions of the Right Hand;- What will be the Companions of the Right Hand?
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> And the Companions of the Left Hand,- what will be the Companions of the Left Hand?
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> And those Foremost (in Faith) will be Foremost (in the Hereafter).
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> These will be those Nearest to Allah.
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> In Gardens of Bliss:
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> A number of people from those of old,
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> And a few from those of later times.
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> (They will be) on Thrones encrusted (with gold and precious stones),
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> Reclining on them, facing each other.
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> Round about them will (serve) youths of perpetual (freshness),
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> With goblets, (shining) beakers, and cups (filled) out of clear-flowing fountains:
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> No after-ache will they receive therefrom, nor will they suffer intoxication:
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> And with fruits, any that they may select:
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> And the flesh of fowls, any that they may desire.
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> And (there will be) Companions with beautiful, big, and lustrous eyes,-
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> Like unto Pearls well-guarded.
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> A Reward for the deeds of their past (life).
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> Not frivolity will they hear therein, nor any taint of ill,-
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> Only the saying, "Peace! Peace".
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> The Companions of the Right Hand,- what will be the Companions of the Right Hand?
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> (They will be) among Lote-trees without thorns,
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> Among Talh trees with flowers (or fruits) piled one above another,-
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> In shade long-extended,
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> By water flowing constantly,
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> And fruit in abundance.
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> Whose season is not limited, nor (supply) forbidden,
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> And on Thrones (of Dignity), raised high.
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> We have created (their Companions) of special creation.
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> And made them virgin - pure (and undefiled), -
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> Beloved (by nature), equal in age,-
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> For the Companions of the Right Hand.
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> A (goodly) number from those of old,
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> And a (goodly) number from those of later times.
<p>
<A NAME="41"><b>41.</b></A> The Companions of the Left Hand,- what will be the Companions of the Left Hand?
<p>
<A NAME="42"><b>42.</b></A> (They will be) in the midst of a Fierce Blast of Fire and in Boiling Water,
<p>
<A NAME="43"><b>43.</b></A> And in the shades of Black Smoke:
<p>
<A NAME="44"><b>44.</b></A> Nothing (will there be) to refresh, nor to please:
<p>
<A NAME="45"><b>45.</b></A> For that they were wont to be indulged, before that, in wealth (and luxury),
<p>
<A NAME="46"><b>46.</b></A> And persisted obstinately in wickedness supreme!
<p>
<A NAME="47"><b>47.</b></A> And they used to say, "What! when we die and become dust and bones, shall we then indeed be raised up again?-
<p>
<A NAME="48"><b>48.</b></A> "(We) and our fathers of old?"
<p>
<A NAME="49"><b>49.</b></A> Say: "Yea, those of old and those of later times,
<p>
<A NAME="50"><b>50.</b></A> "All will certainly be gathered together for the meeting appointed for a Day well-known.
<p>
<A NAME="51"><b>51.</b></A> "Then will ye truly,- O ye that go wrong, and treat (Truth) as Falsehood!-
<p>
<A NAME="52"><b>52.</b></A> "Ye will surely taste of the Tree of Zaqqum.
<p>
<A NAME="53"><b>53.</b></A> "Then will ye fill your insides therewith,
<p>
<A NAME="54"><b>54.</b></A> "And drink Boiling Water on top of it:
<p>
<A NAME="55"><b>55.</b></A> "Indeed ye shall drink like diseased camels raging with thirst!"
<p>
<A NAME="56"><b>56.</b></A> Such will be their entertainment on the Day of Requital!
<p>
<A NAME="57"><b>57.</b></A> It is We Who have created you: why will ye not witness the Truth?
<p>
<A NAME="58"><b>58.</b></A> Do ye then see?- The (human Seed) that ye throw out,-
<p>
<A NAME="59"><b>59.</b></A> Is it ye who create it, or are We the Creators?
<p>
<A NAME="60"><b>60.</b></A> We have decreed Death to be your common lot, and We are not to be frustrated
<p>
<A NAME="61"><b>61.</b></A> from changing your Forms and creating you (again) in (forms) that ye know not.
<p>
<A NAME="62"><b>62.</b></A> And ye certainly know already the first form of creation: why then do ye not celebrate His praises?
<p>
<A NAME="63"><b>63.</b></A> See ye the seed that ye sow in the ground?
<p>
<A NAME="64"><b>64.</b></A> Is it ye that cause it to grow, or are We the Cause?
<p>
<A NAME="65"><b>65.</b></A> Were it Our Will, We could crumble it to dry powder, and ye would be left in wonderment,
<p>
<A NAME="66"><b>66.</b></A> (Saying), "We are indeed left with debts (for nothing):
<p>
<A NAME="67"><b>67.</b></A> "Indeed are we shut out (of the fruits of our labour)"
<p>
<A NAME="68"><b>68.</b></A> See ye the water which ye drink?
<p>
<A NAME="69"><b>69.</b></A> Do ye bring it down (in rain) from the cloud or do We?
<p>
<A NAME="70"><b>70.</b></A> Were it Our Will, We could make it salt (and unpalatable): then why do ye not give thanks?
<p>
<A NAME="71"><b>71.</b></A> See ye the Fire which ye kindle?
<p>
<A NAME="72"><b>72.</b></A> Is it ye who grow the tree which feeds the fire, or do We grow it?
<p>
<A NAME="73"><b>73.</b></A> We have made it a memorial (of Our handiwork), and an article of comfort and convenience for the denizens of deserts.
<p>
<A NAME="74"><b>74.</b></A> Then celebrate with praises the name of thy Lord, the Supreme!
<p>
<A NAME="75"><b>75.</b></A> Furthermore I call to witness the setting of the Stars,-
<p>
<A NAME="76"><b>76.</b></A> And that is indeed a mighty adjuration if ye but knew,-
<p>
<A NAME="77"><b>77.</b></A> That this is indeed a qur'an Most Honourable,
<p>
<A NAME="78"><b>78.</b></A> In Book well-guarded,
<p>
<A NAME="79"><b>79.</b></A> Which none shall touch but those who are clean:
<p>
<A NAME="80"><b>80.</b></A> A Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.
<p>
<A NAME="81"><b>81.</b></A> Is it such a Message that ye would hold in light esteem?
<p>
<A NAME="82"><b>82.</b></A> And have ye made it your livelihood that ye should declare it false?
<p>
<A NAME="83"><b>83.</b></A> Then why do ye not (intervene) when (the soul of the dying man) reaches the throat,-
<p>
<A NAME="84"><b>84.</b></A> And ye the while (sit) looking on,-
<p>
<A NAME="85"><b>85.</b></A> But We are nearer to him than ye, and yet see not,-
<p>
<A NAME="86"><b>86.</b></A> Then why do ye not,- If you are exempt from (future) account,-
<p>
<A NAME="87"><b>87.</b></A> Call back the soul, if ye are true (in the claim of independence)?
<p>
<A NAME="88"><b>88.</b></A> Thus, then, if he be of those Nearest to Allah,
<p>
<A NAME="89"><b>89.</b></A> (There is for him) Rest and Satisfaction, and a Garden of Delights.
<p>
<A NAME="90"><b>90.</b></A> And if he be of the Companions of the Right Hand,
<p>
<A NAME="91"><b>91.</b></A> (For him is the salutation), "Peace be unto thee", from the Companions of the Right Hand.
<p>
<A NAME="92"><b>92.</b></A> And if he be of those who treat (Truth) as Falsehood, who go wrong,
<p>
<A NAME="93"><b>93.</b></A> For him is Entertainment with Boiling Water.
<p>
<A NAME="94"><b>94.</b></A> And burning in Hell-Fire.
<p>
<A NAME="95"><b>95.</b></A> Verily, this is the Very Truth and Certainly.
<p>
<A NAME="96"><b>96.</b></A> So celebrate with praises the name of thy Lord, the Supreme.
