<title>80. He Frowned!</title>
<h1>Surah 80. He Frowned!</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> (The Prophet) frowned and turned away,
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> Because there came to him the blind man (interrupting).
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> But what could tell thee but that perchance he might grow (in spiritual understanding)?-
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> Or that he might receive admonition, and the teaching might profit him?
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> As to one who regards Himself as self-sufficient,
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> To him dost thou attend;
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Though it is no blame to thee if he grow not (in spiritual understanding).
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> But as to him who came to thee striving earnestly,
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> And with fear (in his heart),
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> Of him wast thou unmindful.
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> By no means (should it be so)! For it is indeed a Message of instruction:
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> Therefore let whoso will, keep it in remembrance.
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> (It is) in Books held (greatly) in honour,
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> Exalted (in dignity), kept pure and holy,
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> (Written) by the hands of scribes-
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> Honourable and Pious and Just.
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> Woe to man! What hath made him reject Allah.
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> From what stuff hath He created him?
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> From a sperm-drop: He hath created him, and then mouldeth him in due proportions;
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> Then doth He make His path smooth for him;
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> Then He causeth him to die, and putteth him in his grave;
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> Then, when it is His Will, He will raise him up (again).
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> By no means hath he fulfilled what Allah hath commanded him.
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> Then let man look at his food, (and how We provide it):
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> For that We pour forth water in abundance,
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> And We split the earth in fragments,
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> And produce therein corn,
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> And Grapes and nutritious plants,
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> And Olives and Dates,
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> And enclosed Gardens, dense with lofty trees,
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> And fruits and fodder,-
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> For use and convenience to you and your cattle.
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> At length, when there comes the Deafening Noise,-
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> That Day shall a man flee from his own brother,
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> And from his mother and his father,
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> And from his wife and his children.
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> Each one of them, that Day, will have enough concern (of his own) to make him indifferent to the others.
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> Some faces that Day will be beaming,
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> Laughing, rejoicing.
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> And other faces that Day will be dust-stained,
<p>
<A NAME="41"><b>41.</b></A> Blackness will cover them:
<p>
<A NAME="42"><b>42.</b></A> Such will be the Rejecters of Allah, the doers of iniquity.
