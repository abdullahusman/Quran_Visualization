<h1>Surah 93. The Morning Hours, Morning Bright!</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> By the Glorious Morning Light,
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> And by the Night when it is still,-
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> Thy Guardian-Lord hath not forsaken thee, nor is He displeased.
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> And verily the Hereafter will be better for thee than the present.
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> And soon will thy Guardian-Lord give thee (that wherewith) thou shalt be well-pleased.
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> Did He not find thee an orphan and give thee shelter (and care)?
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> And He found thee wandering, and He gave thee guidance.
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> And He found thee in need, and made thee independent.
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> Therefore, treat not the orphan with harshness,
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> Nor repulse the petitioner (unheard);
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> But the bounty of the Lord - rehearse and proclaim!
