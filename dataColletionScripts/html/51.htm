<title>51. The Winnowing Winds</title>
<h1>Surah 51. The Winnowing Winds</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> By the (Winds) that scatter broadcast;
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> And those that lift and bear away heavy weights;
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> And those that flow with ease and gentleness;
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> And those that distribute and apportion by Command;-
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> Verily that which ye are promised is true;
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> And verily Judgment and Justice must indeed come to pass.
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> By the Sky with (its) numerous Paths,
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> Truly ye are in a doctrine discordant,
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> Through which are deluded (away from the Truth) such as would be deluded.
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> Woe to the falsehood-mongers,-
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> Those who (flounder) heedless in a flood of confusion:
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> They ask, "When will be the Day of Judgment and Justice?"
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> (It will be) a Day when they will be tried (and tested) over the Fire!
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> "Taste ye your trial! This is what ye used to ask to be hastened!"
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> As to the Righteous, they will be in the midst of Gardens and Springs,
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> Taking joy in the things which their Lord gives them, because, before then, they lived a good life.
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> They were in the habit of sleeping but little by night,
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> And in the hour of early dawn, they (were found) praying for Forgiveness;
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> And in their wealth and possessions (was remembered) the right of the (needy,) him who asked, and him who (for some reason) was prevented (from asking).
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> On the earth are signs for those of assured Faith,
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> As also in your own selves: Will ye not then see?
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> And in heaven is your Sustenance, as (also) that which ye are promised.
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> Then, by the Lord of heaven and earth, this is the very Truth, as much as the fact that ye can speak intelligently to each other.
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> Has the story reached thee, of the honoured guests of Abraham?
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> Behold, they entered his presence, and said: "Peace!" He said, "Peace!" (and thought, "These seem) unusual people."
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> Then he turned quickly to his household, brought out a fatted calf,
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> And placed it before them.. he said, "Will ye not eat?"
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> (When they did not eat), He conceived a fear of them. They said, "Fear not," and they gave him glad tidings of a son endowed with knowledge.
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> But his wife came forward (laughing) aloud: she smote her forehead and said: "A barren old woman!"
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> They said, "Even so has thy Lord spoken: and He is full of Wisdom and Knowledge."
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> (Abraham) said: "And what, O ye Messengers, is your errand (now)?"
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> They said, "We have been sent to a people (deep) in sin;-
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> "To bring on, on them, (a shower of) stones of clay (brimstone),
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> "Marked as from thy Lord for those who trespass beyond bounds."
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> Then We evacuated those of the Believers who were there,
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> But We found not there any just (Muslim) persons except in one house:
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> And We left there a Sign for such as fear the Grievous Penalty.
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> And in Moses (was another Sign): Behold, We sent him to Pharaoh, with authority manifest.
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> But (Pharaoh) turned back with his Chiefs, and said, "A sorcerer, or one possessed!"
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> So We took him and his forces, and threw them into the sea; and his was the blame.
<p>
<A NAME="41"><b>41.</b></A> And in the 'Ad (people) (was another Sign): Behold, We sent against them the devastating Wind:
<p>
<A NAME="42"><b>42.</b></A> It left nothing whatever that it came up against, but reduced it to ruin and rottenness.
<p>
<A NAME="43"><b>43.</b></A> And in the Thamud (was another Sign): Behold, they were told, "Enjoy (your brief day) for a little while!"
<p>
<A NAME="44"><b>44.</b></A> But they insolently defied the Command of their Lord: So the stunning noise (of an earthquake) seized them, even while they were looking on.
<p>
<A NAME="45"><b>45.</b></A> Then they could not even stand (on their feet), nor could they help themselves.
<p>
<A NAME="46"><b>46.</b></A> So were the People of Noah before them for they wickedly transgressed.
<p>
<A NAME="47"><b>47.</b></A> With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: for it is We Who create the vastness of pace.
<p>
<A NAME="48"><b>48.</b></A> And We have spread out the (spacious) earth: How excellently We do spread out!
<p>
<A NAME="49"><b>49.</b></A> And of every thing We have created pairs: That ye may receive instruction.
<p>
<A NAME="50"><b>50.</b></A> Hasten ye then (at once) to Allah. I am from Him a Warner to you, clear and open!
<p>
<A NAME="51"><b>51.</b></A> And make not another an object of worship with Allah. I am from Him a Warner to you, clear and open!
<p>
<A NAME="52"><b>52.</b></A> Similarly, no apostle came to the Peoples before them, but they said (of him) in like manner, "A sorcerer, or one possessed"!
<p>
<A NAME="53"><b>53.</b></A> Is this the legacy they have transmitted, one to another? Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!
<p>
<A NAME="54"><b>54.</b></A> So turn away from them: not thine is the blame.
<p>
<A NAME="55"><b>55.</b></A> But teach (thy Message) for teaching benefits the Believers.
<p>
<A NAME="56"><b>56.</b></A> I have only created Jinns and men, that they may serve Me.
<p>
<A NAME="57"><b>57.</b></A> No Sustenance do I require of them, nor do I require that they should feed Me.
<p>
<A NAME="58"><b>58.</b></A> For Allah is He Who gives (all) Sustenance,- Lord of Power,- Steadfast (for ever).
<p>
<A NAME="59"><b>59.</b></A> For the Wrong-doers, their portion is like unto the portion of their fellows (of earlier generations): then let them not ask Me to hasten (that portion)!
<p>
<A NAME="60"><b>60.</b></A> Woe, then, to the Unbelievers, on account of that Day of theirs which they have been promised!
