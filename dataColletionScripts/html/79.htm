<h1>Surah 79. Those Who Drag Forth, Soul-snatchers</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> By the (angels) who tear out (the souls of the wicked) with violence;
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> By those who gently draw out (the souls of the blessed);
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> And by those who glide along (on errands of mercy),
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> Then press forward as in a race,
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> Then arrange to do (the Commands of their Lord),
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> One Day everything that can be in commotion will be in violent commotion,
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Followed by oft-repeated (commotions):
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> Hearts that Day will be in agitation;
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> Cast down will be (their owners') eyes.
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> They say (now): "What! shall we indeed be returned to (our) former state?
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> "What! - when we shall have become rotten bones?"
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> They say: "It would, in that case, be a return with loss!"
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> But verily, it will be but a single (Compelling) Cry,
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> When, behold, they will be in the (full) awakening (to Judgment).
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> Has the story of Moses reached thee?
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> Behold, thy Lord did call to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa:-
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> "Go thou to Pharaoh for he has indeed transgressed all bounds:
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> "And say to him, 'Wouldst thou that thou shouldst be purified (from sin)?-
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> "'And that I guide thee to thy Lord, so thou shouldst fear Him?'"
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> Then did (Moses) show him the Great Sign.
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> But (Pharaoh) rejected it and disobeyed (guidance);
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> Further, he turned his back, striving hard (against Allah..
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> Then he collected (his men) and made a proclamation,
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> Saying, "I am your Lord, Most High".
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> But Allah did punish him, (and made an) example of him, - in the Hereafter, as in this life.
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> Verily in this is an instructive warning for whosoever feareth ((Allah)).
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> What! Are ye the more difficult to create or the heaven (above)? ((Allah)) hath constructed it:
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> On high hath He raised its canopy, and He hath given it order and perfection.
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> Its night doth He endow with darkness, and its splendour doth He bring out (with light).
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> And the earth, moreover, hath He extended (to a wide expanse);
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> He draweth out therefrom its moisture and its pasture;
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> And the mountains hath He firmly fixed;-
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> For use and convenience to you and your cattle.
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> Therefore, when there comes the great, overwhelming (Event),-
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> The Day when man shall remember (all) that he strove for,
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> And Hell-Fire shall be placed in full view for (all) to see,-
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> Then, for such as had transgressed all bounds,
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> And had preferred the life of this world,
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> The Abode will be Hell-Fire;
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> And for such as had entertained the fear of standing before their Lord's (tribunal) and had restrained (their) soul from lower desires,
<p>
<A NAME="41"><b>41.</b></A> Their abode will be the Garden.
<p>
<A NAME="42"><b>42.</b></A> They ask thee about the Hour,-'When will be its appointed time?
<p>
<A NAME="43"><b>43.</b></A> Wherein art thou (concerned) with the declaration thereof?
<p>
<A NAME="44"><b>44.</b></A> With thy Lord in the Limit fixed therefor.
<p>
<A NAME="45"><b>45.</b></A> Thou art but a Warner for such as fear it.
<p>
<A NAME="46"><b>46.</b></A> The Day they see it, (It will be) as if they had tarried but a single evening, or (at most till) the following morn!
