<title>75. The Rising Of The Dead, Resurrection</title>
<h1>Surah 75. The Rising Of The Dead, Resurrection</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> I do call to witness the Resurrection Day;
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> And I do call to witness the self-reproaching spirit: (Eschew Evil).
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> Does man think that We cannot assemble his bones?
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> Nay, We are able to put together in perfect order the very tips of his fingers.
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> But man wishes to do wrong (even) in the time in front of him.
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> He questions: "When is the Day of Resurrection?"
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> At length, when the sight is dazed,
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> And the moon is buried in darkness.
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> And the sun and moon are joined together,-
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> That Day will Man say: "Where is the refuge?"
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> By no means! No place of safety!
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> Before thy Lord (alone), that Day will be the place of rest.
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> That Day will Man be told (all) that he put forward, and all that he put back.
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> Nay, man will be evidence against himself,
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> Even though he were to put up his excuses.
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> Move not thy tongue concerning the (Qur'an) to make haste therewith.
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> It is for Us to collect it and to promulgate it:
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> But when We have promulgated it, follow thou its recital (as promulgated):
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> Nay more, it is for Us to explain it (and make it clear):
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> Nay, (ye men!) but ye love the fleeting life,
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> And leave alone the Hereafter.
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> Some faces, that Day, will beam (in brightness and beauty);-
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> Looking towards their Lord;
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> And some faces, that Day, will be sad and dismal,
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> In the thought that some back-breaking calamity was about to be inflicted on them;
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> Yea, when (the soul) reaches to the collar-bone (in its exit),
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> And there will be a cry, "Who is a magician (to restore him)?"
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> And he will conclude that it was (the Time) of Parting;
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> And one leg will be joined with another:
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> That Day the Drive will be (all) to thy Lord!
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> So he gave nothing in charity, nor did he pray!-
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> But on the contrary, he rejected Truth and turned away!
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> Then did he stalk to his family in full conceit!
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> Woe to thee, (O men!), yea, woe!
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> Again, Woe to thee, (O men!), yea, woe!
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> Does man think that he will be left uncontrolled, (without purpose)?
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> Was he not a drop of sperm emitted (in lowly form)?
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> Then did he become a leech-like clot; then did ((Allah)) make and fashion (him) in due proportion.
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> And of him He made two sexes, male and female.
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> Has not He, (the same), the power to give life to the dead?
