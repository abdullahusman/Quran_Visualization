<h1>Surah 74. The Cloaked One, The Man Wearing A Cloak</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> O thou wrapped up (in the mantle)!
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> Arise and deliver thy warning!
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> And thy Lord do thou magnify!
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> And thy garments keep free from stain!
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> And all abomination shun!
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> Nor expect, in giving, any increase (for thyself)!
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> But, for thy Lord's (Cause), be patient and constant!
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> Finally, when the Trumpet is sounded,
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> That will be- that Day - a Day of Distress,-
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> Far from easy for those without Faith.
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> Leave Me alone, (to deal) with the (creature) whom I created (bare and) alone!-
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> To whom I granted resources in abundance,
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> And sons to be by his side!-
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> To whom I made (life) smooth and comfortable!
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> Yet is he greedy-that I should add (yet more);-
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> By no means! For to Our Signs he has been refractory!
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> Soon will I visit him with a mount of calamities!
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> For he thought and he plotted;-
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> And woe to him! How he plotted!-
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> Yea, Woe to him; How he plotted!-
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> Then he looked round;
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> Then he frowned and he scowled;
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> Then he turned back and was haughty;
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> Then said he: "This is nothing but magic, derived from of old;
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> "This is nothing but the word of a mortal!"
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> Soon will I cast him into Hell-Fire!
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> And what will explain to thee what Hell-Fire is?
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> Naught doth it permit to endure, and naught doth it leave alone!-
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> Darkening and changing the colour of man!
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> Over it are Nineteen.
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> And We have set none but angels as Guardians of the Fire; and We have fixed their number only as a trial for Unbelievers,- in order that the People of the Book may arrive at certainty, and the Believers may increase in Faith,- and that no doubts may be left for the People of the Book and the Believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the Unbelievers may say, "What symbol doth Allah intend by this ?" Thus doth Allah leave to stray whom He pleaseth, and guide whom He pleaseth: and none can know the forces of thy Lord, except He and this is no other than a warning to mankind.
<p>
<A NAME="32"><b>32.</b></A> Nay, verily: By the Moon,
<p>
<A NAME="33"><b>33.</b></A> And by the Night as it retreateth,
<p>
<A NAME="34"><b>34.</b></A> And by the Dawn as it shineth forth,-
<p>
<A NAME="35"><b>35.</b></A> This is but one of the mighty (portents),
<p>
<A NAME="36"><b>36.</b></A> A warning to mankind,-
<p>
<A NAME="37"><b>37.</b></A> To any of you that chooses to press forward, or to follow behind;-
<p>
<A NAME="38"><b>38.</b></A> Every soul will be (held) in pledge for its deeds.
<p>
<A NAME="39"><b>39.</b></A> Except the Companions of the Right Hand.
<p>
<A NAME="40"><b>40.</b></A> (They will be) in Gardens (of Delight): they will question each other,
<p>
<A NAME="41"><b>41.</b></A> And (ask) of the Sinners:
<p>
<A NAME="42"><b>42.</b></A> "What led you into Hell Fire?"
<p>
<A NAME="43"><b>43.</b></A> They will say: "We were not of those who prayed;
<p>
<A NAME="44"><b>44.</b></A> "Nor were we of those who fed the indigent;
<p>
<A NAME="45"><b>45.</b></A> "But we used to talk vanities with vain talkers;
<p>
<A NAME="46"><b>46.</b></A> "And we used to deny the Day of Judgment,
<p>
<A NAME="47"><b>47.</b></A> "Until there came to us (the Hour) that is certain."
<p>
<A NAME="48"><b>48.</b></A> Then will no intercession of (any) intercessors profit them.
<p>
<A NAME="49"><b>49.</b></A> Then what is the matter with them that they turn away from admonition?-
<p>
<A NAME="50"><b>50.</b></A> As if they were affrighted asses,
<p>
<A NAME="51"><b>51.</b></A> Fleeing from a lion!
<p>
<A NAME="52"><b>52.</b></A> Forsooth, each one of them wants to be given scrolls (of revelation) spread out!
<p>
<A NAME="53"><b>53.</b></A> By no means! But they fear not the Hereafter,
<p>
<A NAME="54"><b>54.</b></A> Nay, this surely is an admonition:
<p>
<A NAME="55"><b>55.</b></A> Let any who will, keep it in remembrance!
<p>
<A NAME="56"><b>56.</b></A> But none will keep it in remembrance except as Allah wills: He is the Lord of Righteousness, and the Lord of Forgiveness.
