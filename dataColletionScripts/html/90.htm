<h1>Surah 90. The City, This Countryside</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> I do call to witness this City;-
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> And thou art a freeman of this City;-
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> And (the mystic ties of) parent and child;-
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> Verily We have created man into toil and struggle.
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> Thinketh he, that none hath power over him?
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> He may say (boastfully); Wealth have I squandered in abundance!
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Thinketh he that none beholdeth him?
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> Have We not made for him a pair of eyes?-
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> And a tongue, and a pair of lips?-
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> And shown him the two highways?
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> But he hath made no haste on the path that is steep.
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> And what will explain to thee the path that is steep?-
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> (It is:) freeing the bondman;
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> Or the giving of food in a day of privation
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> To the orphan with claims of relationship,
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> Or to the indigent (down) in the dust.
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> Then will he be of those who believe, and enjoin patience, (constancy, and self-restraint), and enjoin deeds of kindness and compassion.
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> Such are the Companions of the Right Hand.
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> But those who reject Our Signs, they are the (unhappy) Companions of the Left Hand.
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> On them will be Fire vaulted over (all round).
