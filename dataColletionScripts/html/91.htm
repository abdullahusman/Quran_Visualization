<h1>Surah 91. The Sun</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> By the Sun and his (glorious) splendour;
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> By the Moon as she follows him;
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> By the Day as it shows up (the Sun's) glory;
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> By the Night as it conceals it;
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> By the Firmament and its (wonderful) structure;
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> By the Earth and its (wide) expanse:
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> By the Soul, and the proportion and order given to it;
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> And its enlightenment as to its wrong and its right;-
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> Truly he succeeds that purifies it,
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> And he fails that corrupts it!
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> The Thamud (people) rejected (their prophet) through their inordinate wrong-doing,
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> Behold, the most wicked man among them was deputed (for impiety).
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> But the Messenger of Allah said to them: "It is a She-camel of Allah. And (bar her not from) having her drink!"
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> Then they rejected him (as a false prophet), and they hamstrung her. So their Lord, on account of their crime, obliterated their traces and made them equal (in destruction, high and low)!
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> And for Him is no fear of its consequences.
