<h1>Surah 84. The Sundering, Splitting Open</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> When the sky is rent asunder,
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> And hearkens to (the Command of) its Lord, and it must needs (do so);-
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> And when the earth is flattened out,
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> And casts forth what is within it and becomes (clean) empty,
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> And hearkens to (the Command of) its Lord,- and it must needs (do so);- (then will come Home the full reality).
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> O thou man! Verily thou art ever toiling on towards thy Lord- painfully toiling,- but thou shalt meet Him.
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Then he who is given his Record in his right hand,
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> Soon will his account be taken by an easy reckoning,
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> And he will turn to his people, rejoicing!
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> But he who is given his Record behind his back,-
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> Soon will he cry for perdition,
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> And he will enter a Blazing Fire.
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> Truly, did he go about among his people, rejoicing!
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> Truly, did he think that he would not have to return (to Us)!
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> Nay, nay! for his Lord was (ever) watchful of him!
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> So I do call to witness the ruddy glow of Sunset;
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> The Night and its Homing;
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> And the Moon in her fullness:
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> Ye shall surely travel from stage to stage.
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> What then is the matter with them, that they believe not?-
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> And when the Qur'an is read to them, they fall not prostrate,
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> But on the contrary the Unbelievers reject (it).
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> But Allah has full knowledge of what they secrete (in their breasts)
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> So announce to them a Penalty Grievous,
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> Except to those who believe and work righteous deeds: For them is a Reward that will never fail.
