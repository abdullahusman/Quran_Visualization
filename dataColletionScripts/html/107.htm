</a>Surah 107. Small Kindnesses, Almsgiving, Have You Seen?</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> Seest thou one who denies the Judgment (to come)?
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> Then such is the (man) who repulses the orphan (with harshness),
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> And encourages not the feeding of the indigent.
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> So woe to the worshippers
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> Who are neglectful of their prayers,
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> Those who (want but) to be seen (of men),
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> But refuse (to supply) (even) neighbourly needs.
