<title>76. Time, Man, (every) Man, This (day-and-age)</title>
<h1>Surah 76. Time, Man, (every) Man, This (day-and-)age</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> Has there not been over Man a long period of Time, when he was nothing - (not even) mentioned?
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> Verily We created Man from a drop of mingled sperm, in order to try him: So We gave him (the gifts), of Hearing and Sight.
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> We showed him the Way: whether he be grateful or ungrateful (rests on his will).
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> For the Rejecters we have prepared chains, yokes, and a blazing Fire.
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> As to the Righteous, they shall drink of a Cup (of Wine) mixed with Kafur,-
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> A Fountain where the Devotees of Allah do drink, making it flow in unstinted abundance.
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> They perform (their) vows, and they fear a Day whose evil flies far and wide.
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> And they feed, for the love of Allah, the indigent, the orphan, and the captive,-
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> (Saying),"We feed you for the sake of Allah alone: no reward do we desire from you, nor thanks.
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> "We only fear a Day of distressful Wrath from the side of our Lord."
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> But Allah will deliver them from the evil of that Day, and will shed over them a Light of Beauty and (blissful) Joy.
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> And because they were patient and constant, He will reward them with a Garden and (garments of) silk.
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> Reclining in the (Garden) on raised thrones, they will see there neither the sun's (excessive heat) nor (the moon's) excessive cold.
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> And the shades of the (Garden) will come low over them, and the bunches (of fruit), there, will hang low in humility.
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> And amongst them will be passed round vessels of silver and goblets of crystal,-
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> Crystal-clear, made of silver: they will determine the measure thereof (according to their wishes).
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> And they will be given to drink there of a Cup (of Wine) mixed with Zanjabil,-
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> A fountain there, called Salsabil.
<p>
<A NAME="19"><b>19.</b></A> And round about them will (serve) youths of perpetual (freshness): If thou seest them, thou wouldst think them scattered Pearls.
<p>
<A NAME="20"><b>20.</b></A> And when thou lookest, it is there thou wilt see a Bliss and a Realm Magnificent.
<p>
<A NAME="21"><b>21.</b></A> Upon them will be green Garments of fine silk and heavy brocade, and they will be adorned with Bracelets of silver; and their Lord will give to them to drink of a Wine Pure and Holy.
<p>
<A NAME="22"><b>22.</b></A> "Verily this is a Reward for you, and your Endeavour is accepted and recognised."
<p>
<A NAME="23"><b>23.</b></A> It is We Who have sent down the Qur'an to thee by stages.
<p>
<A NAME="24"><b>24.</b></A> Therefore be patient with constancy to the Command of thy Lord, and hearken not to the sinner or the ingrate among them.
<p>
<A NAME="25"><b>25.</b></A> And celebrate the name or thy Lord morning and evening,
<p>
<A NAME="26"><b>26.</b></A> And part of the night, prostrate thyself to Him; and glorify Him a long night through.
<p>
<A NAME="27"><b>27.</b></A> As to these, they love the fleeting life, and put away behind them a Day (that will be) hard.
<p>
<A NAME="28"><b>28.</b></A> It is We Who created them, and We have made their joints strong; but, when We will, We can substitute the like of them by a complete change.
<p>
<A NAME="29"><b>29.</b></A> This is an admonition: Whosoever will, let him take a (straight) Path to his Lord.
<p>
<A NAME="30"><b>30.</b></A> But ye will not, except as Allah wills; for Allah is full of Knowledge and Wisdom.
<p>
<A NAME="31"><b>31.</b></A> He will admit to His Mercy whom He will; But the wrong-doers,- for them has He prepared a grievous Penalty.
