Surah 100. The Courser, The Chargers</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> By the (Steeds) that run, with panting (breath),
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> And strike sparks of fire,
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> And push home the charge in the morning,
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> And raise the dust in clouds the while,
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> And penetrate forthwith into the midst (of the foe) en masse;-
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> Truly man is, to his Lord, ungrateful;
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> And to that (fact) he bears witness (by his deeds);
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> And violent is he in his love of wealth.
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> Does he not know,- when that which is in the graves is scattered abroad
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> And that which is (locked up) in (human) breasts is made manifest-
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> That their Lord had been Well-acquainted with them, (even to) that Day.?
