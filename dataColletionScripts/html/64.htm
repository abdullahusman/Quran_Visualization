<title>64. Mutual Disillusion, Haggling</title>
<h1>Surah 64. Mutual Disillusion, Haggling</h1>
<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> Whatever is in the heavens and on earth, doth declare the Praises and Glory of Allah. to Him belongs dominion, and to Him belongs praise: and He has power over all things.
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> It is He Who has created you; and of you are some that are Unbelievers, and some that are Believers: and Allah sees well all that ye do.
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> He has created the heavens and the earth in just proportions, and has given you shape, and made your shapes beautiful: and to Him is the final Goal.
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> He knows what is in the heavens and on earth; and He knows what ye conceal and what ye reveal: yea, Allah knows well the (secrets) of (all) hearts.
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> Has not the story reached you, of those who rejected Faith aforetime? So they tasted the evil result of their conduct; and they had a grievous Penalty.
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> That was because there came to them apostles with Clear Signs, but they said: "Shall (mere) human beings direct us?" So they rejected (the Message) and turned away. But Allah can do without (them): and Allah is free of all needs, worthy of all praise.
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> The Unbelievers think that they will not be raised up (for Judgment). Say: "Yea, By my Lord, Ye shall surely be raised up: then shall ye be told (the truth) of all that ye did. And that is easy for Allah."
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> Believe, therefore, in Allah and His Messenger, and in the Light which we have sent down. And Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do.
<p>
<A NAME="9"><b>9.</b></A> The Day that He assembles you (all) for a Day of Assembly,- that will be a Day of mutual loss and gain (among you), and those who believe in Allah and work righteousness,- He will remove from them their ills, and He will admit them to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever: that will be the Supreme Achievement.
<p>
<A NAME="10"><b>10.</b></A> But those who reject Faith and treat Our Signs as falsehoods, they will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein for aye: and evil is that Goal.
<p>
<A NAME="11"><b>11.</b></A> No kind of calamity can occur, except by the leave of Allah. and if any one believes in Allah, ((Allah)) guides his heart (aright): for Allah knows all things.
<p>
<A NAME="12"><b>12.</b></A> So obey Allah, and obey His Messenger. but if ye turn back, the duty of Our Messenger is but to proclaim (the Message) clearly and openly.
<p>
<A NAME="13"><b>13.</b></A> Allah. There is no god but He: and on Allah, therefore, let the Believers put their trust.
<p>
<A NAME="14"><b>14.</b></A> O ye who believe! Truly, among your wives and your children are (some that are) enemies to yourselves: so beware of them! But if ye forgive and overlook, and cover up (their faults), verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
<p>
<A NAME="15"><b>15.</b></A> Your riches and your children may be but a trial: but in the Presence of Allah, is the highest, Reward.
<p>
<A NAME="16"><b>16.</b></A> So fear Allah as much as ye can; listen and obey and spend in charity for the benefit of your own soul and those saved from the covetousness of their own souls,- they are the ones that achieve prosperity.
<p>
<A NAME="17"><b>17.</b></A> If ye loan to Allah, a beautiful loan, He will double it to your (credit), and He will grant you Forgiveness: for Allah is most Ready to appreciate (service), Most Forbearing,-
<p>
<A NAME="18"><b>18.</b></A> Knower of what is open, Exalted in Might, Full of Wisdom.
