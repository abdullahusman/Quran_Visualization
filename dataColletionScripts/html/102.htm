<p>
<A NAME="1"><b>1.</b></A> The mutual rivalry for piling up (the good things of this world) diverts you (from the more serious things),
<p>
<A NAME="2"><b>2.</b></A> Until ye visit the graves.
<p>
<A NAME="3"><b>3.</b></A> But nay, ye soon shall know (the reality).
<p>
<A NAME="4"><b>4.</b></A> Again, ye soon shall know!
<p>
<A NAME="5"><b>5.</b></A> Nay, were ye to know with certainty of mind, (ye would beware!)
<p>
<A NAME="6"><b>6.</b></A> Ye shall certainly see Hell-Fire!
<p>
<A NAME="7"><b>7.</b></A> Again, ye shall see it with certainty of sight!
<p>
<A NAME="8"><b>8.</b></A> Then, shall ye be questioned that Day about the joy (ye indulged in!).
